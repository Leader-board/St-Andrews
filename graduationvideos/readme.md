# St Andrews graduation videos (and transcripts())

This section historically contained graduation videos from June 2019 (onwards) which were important because St Andrews historically took them down soon after the ceremony because of licensing issues then. Since then,

* I'm no longer a student there, and hence cannot provide them at a location where only students can access
* Since the June 2021 graduation diets, St Andrews has published *most* of them directly on their YouTube page

This means that this section is not as important as it used to be. That being said, past recordings from June 2019 (and current ones) are still backed up, and can be retrieved on request. Please contact me at leader-board {at} outlook.com if needed.

What is available however are the transcripts of these videos, generated automatically using Azure Cognitive Services. This is because to my understanding, they are not bound by St Andrews' rules which forbid public sharing of the videos themselves (which is why they are not made public here).
