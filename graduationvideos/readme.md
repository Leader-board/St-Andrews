# St Andrews graduation videos
This section contains the St Andrews graduation videos (for the June 2019 - 2021 diets) that I have saved so that you can watch it again or download it later (as St Andrews takes down the stream shortly after).

##  Important notes

 1. These videos are only meant to be used by St Andrews users and friends and I have done so in good faith. In particular, these videos are published in accordance with St Andrews' [licensing policy](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/graduation/watch-live/) - no commercial users please. Please do not re-upload these videos into public sites like YouTube.
 2. For this reason, you will need to log in with your St Andrews university account to view or download them (as they are still currently valid for students who have already graduated) if you already haven't. If this is not possible for any reason or you need to share this with someone else, please contact [me](mailto:dm282@st-andrews.ac.uk).
 3. It is unlikely that this resource will be publicly available after the June 2021 diets since I'm graduating. It is not expected that the resource will be publicly available since some users have objected to my good-faith project citing privacy and stuff; however, I plan to maintain this privately.
