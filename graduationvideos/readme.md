# St Andrews graduation videos
This section contains the St Andrews graduation videos (only this diet - June 2019) that I have saved so that you can watch it again or download it later (as St Andrews takes down the stream shortly after).

##  Important notes

 1. These videos are only meant to be used by St Andrews users and friends and I have done so in good faith. In particular, these videos are published in accordance with St Andrews' [licensing policy](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/graduation/watch-live/) - no commercial users please. Please do not re-upload these videos into public sites like YouTube.
 2. For this reason, you will need to log in with your St Andrews university account to view or download them (as they are still currently valid for students who have already graduated) if you already haven't. If this is not possible for any reason, please contact dm282@st-andrews.ac.uk.
