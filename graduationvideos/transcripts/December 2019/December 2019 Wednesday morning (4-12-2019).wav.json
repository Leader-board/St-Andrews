periostin christum dominum nostrum amen please be seated good morning everybody i'm delighted to welcome you all to this graduation ceremony at this gathering which officially is a meeting of the senatus academicos scholars become masters masters become doctors new professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured it is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation the ceremony marks a significant right of passage in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation become something that they were not before and that moment is witnessed by everyone here in the hall today saint andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation we are proud to be scotland 's first and most ancient university we are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for so i will now tell you something about the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony at this point i would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honourary graduate lyria de la cruth hernandez the largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at masters and doctoral level we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin in accordance with saint andrews tradition we call upon the deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and we then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say ete superette meaning and upon you too graduations are conferred by me as vice chancellor the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate and this particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the bricks or trousers of one of this university 's most famous sixteenth century students john knox the major proponent of the reformation in scotland and author amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women so i am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had different origins it was purchased for the doctoral graduation in sixteen ninety six of sir john arbuthnot the celebrated scottish physician and satirist so his cap has been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the seventeenth century as my colleagues and i processed into the younger hall today you will have noted the academic procession was headed by the universities masses which are now placed to either side of me and which together form a collection unrivalled amongst any university in the world mesas are effectively sectors or staffs of office and thus are symbols of the academic authority of the university they are an immensely venerable part of academic tradition three of our mases are of particular antiquity and importance in fourteen sixteen three years after the foundation of the university the dean of arts expended the then princely sum of five pounds to commission a mace for the faculty of arts and it's in the middle of the stand to your left there were few buildings no library and scarce teaching materials so this investment in a mace communicates much of the power such objects hold the canon law mace which is in the middle on your right was produced in the a bit later in the mid fifteenth century most probably by a scottish goldsmith and with a view to challenging the preeminence of the arts faculty at the time the traditions of academic rivalry date back to our very foundation the two maces were complemented in fourteen sixty one by the saint salvatore's mace which is the most elaborate and beautifully wrought of the medieval maces today it's on your left it's the one closest to me it was commissioned by bishop james kennedy the founder of since our vatas the other maces have been all commissioned in the last seventy five years signifying that objects of this nature have continuing symbolic value allowing us to remain strongly in contact with our history as we add to it so to return now to today's ceremony after students have been awarded their degrees members of since our vetas chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the induction of new professors and then the conferment of an honorary degree on lyria de la cruz hernandez and then the graduation address which today will be delivered by doctor william tooman the university will close with the benedict sorry the ceremony will close with the benediction by the university chaplain i'm not intending to close the university community and after after that the new graduates will join the academic procession graduation is the highlight of the university year we're so pleased that all of you are here to share in the success of our graduates i hope that this is a memorable and happy day for all of you dechellis faculty artis arzum vice chancellor i have the

cruz hernandez lydia de la cruz hernandez was born in madrid in nineteen sixty nine into a loving itano or spanish gypsy roma family she grew up in a deprived area of the city and like many other hatana girls at the time left the school before finishing her primary education and married in her teens for most of her life lydia worked as a street seller selling textiles in busy open air markets her day to day life was typical of many kitana women in the poorer districts of madrid dedicated to her family she lived very much within the embrace of her community i first met lydia in nineteen ninety two when as a young mother she agreed to be one of my research subjects in a state build kitano ghetto with tremendous generosity she allowed me and non hidano anthropologist to observe her life and she also invited me to live in her home during her field work from the start i was struck by her determined trade vivre by her resilience and by her enthusiasm for anthropology we became great friends and over several years i wrote about her her family and her neighbours then in two thousand and nine lydia herself has started writing down her life story by hand on large ruled notebooks describing her experience campaigning against the segregation of itano children in the schools of her district and this was the beginning of a new collaboration she became my co investigator and co author we went on to write an academic monograph and several articles in international peer reviewed journals with this work lydia has made an important contribution to the progress of collaborative anthropology she has helped develop concrete strategies to open up anthropological research to a wider public and in particular to the scrutiny of research participants her work emphasizes the crucial role that these participants play in the creation of academic anthropological knowledge and in this way it contributes to the decolonization of the discipline and indeed of scholarship more widely lydia has also done much to help anthropologists understand the intricate workings of the kitano customary law and its complex relationship to women 's lives and not only has lydia produced a stimulating innovative scholarly work but she has also made an extremely positive contribution to the teaching and learning of social anthropology at saint andrews since two thousand and nine she has returned to the university almost every year to participate in classes for undergraduates and postgraduates at every level from first year to PHD in these classes lydia discusses with students had different experiences with anthropology first as a research participant then as investigator and author she's a dynamic speaker who talks with two students with candor passion and insight and they value enormously the opportunity to see anthropology as it appears from the point of view of those we study this ongoing willingness to participate in a teaching helps make the learning of social anthropology at saint andrews truly unique in all of these lydia is exceptional to understand her achievements it is necessary to remember the radical marginalization poverty and the privation that most roma people continue to experience across europe today lydia de la cruz fernandez is one of very few roma women of any nationality to have had written work of any kind published she's one of very few roma men or women to have produced internationally recognized academic work she is a role model for girls and young women worldwide both roma and non roma by chancellor in recognition of her contribution to the field of social anthropology to the study of roma lives and to the teaching of social anthropology at saint andrews i invite you to confer the title of master of arts honoris causa

call upon doctor william tooman of the school of divinity vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen and most importantly graduating students congratulations today is your day now the last time i had the pleasure of addressing a class of happy saint andrews graduates the theme of my speech was death keeping to tradition i have striven to identify a similarly modeling topic for your day of glory and joy i thought long and i thought hard about topics like contagious disease and bankruptcy and toothache but in the end i settled on a run of the mill graduation theme the theme of ambition as new graduates you are freshers all over again entering a new phase of life not knowing exactly how to go about it or what it will bring you this comes with appropriate measure of uncertainty and anxiety but most of you i'm sure will hope to excel to rise however slowly in position and prosperity so you're probably expecting me to celebrate ambition you are i suspect anticipating quotations like emerson 's pretentious adage ambition is the germ from which all growth of nobleness proceeds you might be bracing yourself for cliches like seize the day or ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose ambition though is not a virtue it is a force of character that leads many to success but it is also the cause of many of the world's greatest ills the need to get only to be getting the need for position only to have power ambition is not in itself good or bad let no one tell you you should be ambitious don't be fooled into thinking it will bring you health or well being or happiness the unpleasant truth is that ambition has no fulfillment there's no achievement that completes it it just goes on and on in some cultures the endlessness of ambition identifies it as a vice rather than a virtue daoist proverbs in this vein abound there is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition there is no calamity greater than discontent there is no fault greater than the wish to be getting put differently ambition is the enemy of contentment but contentment good as it might be for your mental health is not anymore a virtue than is ambition the pursuit of contentment can be profoundly self-centered it can lead to artificial prioritization of one 's personal good to the neglect of others protecting your time your money your health can be self defeating causing you to live in a bubble of self with narrow horizons and comfortable habits so what can you do if ambition and contentment are irrevocably intention which do you choose now twice already i've used the word virtue for some of you i imagine virtue is a word deserving only of a smirk a self serving word a word for suckers a threadbare religious word fear not i am not going to extol the virtues of virtue i am not going to tell you to throw in your lot with the common good whatever that might be or to forego personal gain i am going to tell you to choose contentment rather than ambition out of self interest the happiest most contented least regretful people are those whose lives revolve around others striving to create happiness and connection and harmony and whatever other kindly word you choose it's those people those who seek what's best for those around them who lead the most contented lives so be selfish by acting selfless i have a friend who started a niche publishing company many years ago early on he had grand ambitions for his one man shop he wanted to grow and to command his corner of the marketplace and as it grew into a three person shop and a ten person shop and eventually into a corporation his ambitions changed he began to use his company to give second chances to people damaged by the endless frictions of the corporate world he began to give positions to people whose personal lives were in ruins he began to see his prophets as a way to invest in people to lend a hand these days his company 's profits are redistributed to his employees and to the charities that they choose together he's established a hardship fund to help extended family members of his employees he's employed refugees my friend still works very long hours but he is one of the most centered and calm and dare i say it contented people that i know we will all of us have deathbed regrets i doubt he will have as many as most of us so why reject ambition because ironically it will not serve you well the late novelist david foster wallace said it more eloquently than i ever could worship power and you will end up feeling weak and afraid and you will need ever more power over others to numb your own fears worship intellect and you will end up feeling stupid and a fraud on the verge of being found out if you worship money and things you will never have enough worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly on one level we all know this stuff already it's been codified in myths and proverbs and cliches and epigrams and parables the whole trick is keeping this truth up front in our daily consciousness because the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or that they're sinful it's that they're unconscious if you like me are not a person who is naturally overflowing with loving kindness it doesn't much matter you don't have to be kind to act kind a study conducted at emory university some years ago asked subjects to wear digital recorders for days at a time capturing every conversation the results of this were astonishing aware that they were being observed test subjects were more empathetic spent more time with other people laughed more and used the word i far less in short they became better people today is your day may you use all your other days selfishly wherever you find yourself whatever you find yourself doing if you dedicate your days to those around you you will discover mysteriously that you have dedicated them to yourselves please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri

spanish gypsy roma family she grew up in a deprived area of the city and like many other hatana girls at the time left the school before finishing her primary education and married in her teens for most of her life lydia worked as a street seller selling textiles in busy open air markets her day to day life was typical of many kitana women in the poorer districts of madrid dedicated to her family she lived very much within the embrace of her community i first met lydia in 1992 when as a young mother she agreed to be one of my research subjects in a state build kitano ghetto with tremendous generosity she allowed me and non hidano anthropologist to observe her life and she also invited me to live in her home during her field work from the start i was struck by her determined trade vivre by her resilience and by her enthusiasm for anthropology we became great friends and over several years i wrote about her her family and her neighbours then in 2009 lydia herself has started writing down her life story by hand on large ruled notebooks describing her experience campaigning against the segregation of itano children in the schools of her district and this was the beginning of a new collaboration she became my co investigator and co author we went on to write an academic monograph and several articles in international peer reviewed journals with this work lydia has made an important contribution to the progress of collaborative anthropology she has helped develop concrete strategies to open up anthropological research to a wider public and in particular to the scrutiny of research participants her work emphasizes the crucial role that these participants play in the creation of academic anthropological knowledge and in this way it contributes to the decolonization of the discipline and indeed of scholarship more widely lydia has also done much to help anthropologists understand the intricate workings of the kitano customary law and its complex relationship to women's lives and not only has lydia produced a stimulating innovative scholarly work but she has also made an extremely positive contribution to the teaching and learning of social anthropology at saint andrews since 2009 she has returned to the university almost every year to participate in classes for undergraduates and postgraduates at every level from first year to PHD in these classes lydia discusses with students had different experiences with anthropology first as a research participant then as investigator and author she's a dynamic speaker who talks with two students with candor passion and insight and they value enormously the opportunity to see anthropology as it appears from the point of view of those we study this ongoing willingness to participate in a teaching helps make the learning of social anthropology at saint andrews truly unique in all of these lydia is exceptional to understand her achievements it is necessary to remember the radical marginalization poverty and the privation that most roma people continue to experience across europe today lydia de la cruz fernandez is one of very few roma women of any nationality to have had written work of any kind published she's one of very few roma men or women to have produced internationally recognized academic work she is a role model for girls and young women worldwide both roma and non roma by chancellor in recognition of her contribution to the field of social anthropology to the study of roma lives and to the teaching of social anthropology at saint andrews i invite you to

congratulations today is your day now the last time i had the pleasure of addressing a class of happy saint andrews graduates the theme of my speech was death keeping to tradition i have striven to identify a similarly modeling topic for your day of glory and joy i thought long and i thought hard about topics like contagious disease and bankruptcy and toothache but in the end i settled on a run of the mill graduation theme the theme of ambition as new graduates you are freshers all over again entering a new phase of life not knowing exactly how to go about it or what it will bring you this comes with appropriate measure of uncertainty and anxiety but most of you i'm sure will hope to excel to rise however slowly in position and prosperity so you're probably expecting me to celebrate ambition you are i suspect anticipating quotations like emerson's pretentious adage ambition is the germ from which all growth of nobleness proceeds you might be bracing yourself for cliches like seize the day or ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose ambition though is not a virtue it is a force of character that leads many to success but it is also the cause of many of the world's greatest ills the need to get only to be getting the need for position only to have power ambition is not in itself good or bad let no one tell you you should be ambitious don't be fooled into thinking it will bring you health or well being or happiness the unpleasant truth is that ambition has no fulfillment there's no achievement that completes it it just goes on and on in some cultures the endlessness of ambition identifies it as a vice rather than a virtue daoist proverbs in this vein abound there is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition there is no calamity greater than discontent there is no fault greater than the wish to be getting put differently ambition is the enemy of contentment but contentment good as it might be for your mental health is not anymore a virtue than is ambition the pursuit of contentment can be profoundly self-centered it can lead to artificial prioritization of 1's personal good to the neglect of others protecting your time your money your health can be self defeating causing you to live in a bubble of self with narrow horizons and comfortable habits so what can you do if ambition and contentment are irrevocably intention which do you choose now twice already i've used the word virtue for some of you i imagine virtue is a word deserving only of a smirk a self serving word a word for suckers a threadbare religious word fear not i am not going to extol the virtues of virtue i am not going to tell you to throw in your lot with the common good whatever that might be or to forego personal gain i am going to tell you to choose contentment rather than ambition out of self interest the happiest most contented least regretful people are those whose lives revolve around others striving to create happiness and connection and harmony and whatever other kindly word you choose it's those people those who seek what's best for those around them who lead the most contented lives so be selfish by acting selfless i have a friend who started a niche publishing company many years ago early on he had grand ambitions for his one man shop he wanted to grow and to command his corner of the marketplace and as it grew into a three person shop and a ten person shop and eventually into a corporation his ambitions changed he began to use his company to give second chances to people damaged by the endless frictions of the corporate world he began to give positions to people whose personal lives were in ruins he began to see his prophets as a way to invest in people to lend a hand these days his company's profits are redistributed to his employees and to the charities that they choose together he's established a hardship fund to help extended family members of his employees he's employed refugees my friend still works very long hours but he is one of the most centered and calm and dare i say it contented people that i know we will all of us have deathbed regrets i doubt he will have as many as most of us so why reject ambition because ironically it will not serve you well the late novelist david foster wallace said it more eloquently than i ever could worship power and you will end up feeling weak and afraid and you will need ever more power over others to numb your own fears worship intellect and you will end up feeling stupid and a fraud on the verge of being found out if you worship money and things you will never have enough worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly on one level we all know this stuff already it's been codified in myths and proverbs and cliches and epigrams and parables the whole trick is keeping this truth up front in our daily consciousness because the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or that they're sinful it's that they're unconscious if you like me are not a person who is naturally overflowing with loving kindness it doesn't much matter you don't have to be kind to act kind a study conducted at emory university some years ago asked subjects to wear digital recorders for days at a time capturing every conversation the results of this were astonishing aware that they were being observed test subjects were more empathetic spent more time with other people laughed more and used the word i far less in short they became better people today is your day may you use all your other days selfishly wherever you find yourself whatever you find yourself doing if you dedicate your days to those around you you will discover mysteriously that you have dedicated them to yourselves please stand for the benediction

      "display": "The. OK. Please. The. OK. Please. Good morning graduates. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Donald McEwen and I'm the chaplain to the university. It is my pleasure to welcome you today to this graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews on this exciting day.

Members of Saint Salvatore Chapel Choir will lead us in singing the Gaudeamus. Please do join in the words can be found in your program. At the end of the graduation ceremony. All our new graduates will join the academic procession. Leaving the younger hall and walking along North Street and entering since Avaitors quadrangle through the Archway.

Good morning everybody. I'm delighted to welcome you all to this graduation ceremony. At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of the Senatus Academicos, scholars become Masters, Masters become doctors, new professors are inducted, and people of distinction are honoured. It is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year, and it is a tradition that honours transformation. The ceremony marks a significant right of passage, in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation become something that they were not before and that moment is witnessed by everyone here in the hall today. Saint Andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking. Important in all of this is that as we change, we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something about the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. At this point I would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honourary graduate Lyria de la Cruth Hernandez. The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at Masters and doctoral level. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin, in accordance with Saint Andrews tradition. We call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though we simply say ETE superette meaning, and upon you too. Graduations are conferred by me as Vice Chancellor. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate and this particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the bricks or trousers of one of this university's most famous 16th century students. John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and author. Amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women. So I am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this CAP actually had different origins. It was purchased for the doctoral graduation in 1696 of Sir John Arbuthnot, the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. So his cap has been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century. As my colleagues and I processed into the younger hall today, you will have noted the academic procession was headed by the universities masses, which are now placed to either side of me and which together form a collection unrivalled amongst any university in the world. Mesas are effectively sectors or Staffs of office and thus are symbols of the academic authority of the university. They are an immensely venerable. Part of academic tradition. Three of our mases are of particular antiquity and importance. In 1416, three years after the foundation of the university, the Dean of Arts expended the then princely sum of £5 to Commission a Mace for the Faculty of Arts, and it's in the middle of the stand to your left. There were few buildings, no library and scarce teaching materials, so this investment in a Mace communicates much of the power. Such objects hold the Canon law Mace, which is in the middle. On your right was produced in the a bit later in the mid 15th century, most probably by a Scottish Goldsmith, and with a view to challenging the preeminence of the arts faculty at the time. The traditions of academic rivalry date back to our very foundation. The two maces were complemented in 1461 by the Saint Salvatore's Mace, which is the most. Elaborate and beautifully wrought of the medieval maces. Today it's on your left. It's the one closest to me. It was commissioned by Bishop James Kennedy, the founder of since our Vatas. The other maces have been all commissioned in the last 75 years, signifying that objects of this nature have continuing symbolic value, allowing us to remain strongly in contact with our history as we add to it. So to return now to today's ceremony, after students have been awarded their degrees, members of since our Vetas Chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the induction of new professors and then the conferment of an honorary degree on Lyria de la Cruz Hernandez and then the graduation address, which today will be delivered by Doctor William Tooman. The university will close with the Benedict. Sorry, the ceremony will close with the benediction. By the university chaplain. I'm not intending to close the university community. And after after that, the new graduates will join the academic procession. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We're so pleased that all of you are here to share in the success of our graduates. I hope that this is a memorable and happy day for all of you. Dechellis faculty Artis arzum.

If I stand sailor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Master of Arts. Honoris causa, Miss Lydia de la Cruz Hernandez. Lydia de la Cruz. Hernandez was born in Madrid in 1969 into a loving Itano or Spanish Gypsy Roma family. She grew up in a deprived area of the city and like many other hatana girls at the time left the school before finishing her primary education and married in her teens. For most of her life, Lydia worked as a street seller selling textiles in busy open air markets. Her day to day life was typical of many Kitana women in the poorer districts of Madrid. Dedicated to her family, she lived very much within the embrace of her community. I first met Lydia in 1992 when, as a young mother, she agreed to be one of my research subjects in a state build Kitano Ghetto. With tremendous generosity, she allowed me and non hidano anthropologist to observe her life, and she also invited me to live in her home during her field work. From the start, I was struck by her determined trade vivre by her resilience and by her enthusiasm for anthropology. We became great friends and over several years I wrote about her, her family, and her neighbours. Then in 2009, Lydia herself has started writing down her life story by hand on large, ruled notebooks describing her experience, campaigning against the segregation of Itano children in the schools of her district. And this was the beginning of a new collaboration. She became my Co investigator and Co. Author. We went on to write an academic monograph and several articles in international peer reviewed journals. With this work, Lydia has made an important contribution to the progress of collaborative anthropology. She has helped develop concrete strategies to open up anthropological research to a wider public and in particular, to the scrutiny of research participants. Her work emphasizes the crucial role that these participants play in the creation of academic anthropological knowledge, and in this way it contributes to the decolonization of the discipline and indeed of scholarship more widely. Lydia has also done much to help anthropologists understand the intricate workings of the Kitano customary law and its complex relationship to women's lives. And not only has Lydia produced a stimulating, innovative scholarly work, but she has also made an extremely positive contribution to the teaching and learning of social anthropology at Saint Andrews. Since 2009 she has returned to the university almost every year to participate in classes for undergraduates and postgraduates at every level from first year to PhD. In these classes, Lydia discusses with students had different experiences with anthropology, first as a research participant, then as investigator and author. She's a dynamic speaker who talks with two students with candor, passion and insight, and they value enormously the opportunity to see anthropology as it appears from the point of view. Of those we study. This ongoing willingness to participate in a teaching helps make the learning of social anthropology at Saint Andrews truly unique. In all of these, Lydia is exceptional to understand her achievements. It is necessary to remember the radical marginalization, poverty, and the privation that most Roma people continue to experience across Europe today. Lydia de la Cruz Fernandez is one of very few Roma women of any nationality to have had written work of any kind published. She's one of very few Roma men or women to have produced internationally recognized academic work. She is a role model for girls and young women worldwide. Both Roma and non Roma. By chancellor in recognition of her contribution to the field of social anthropology to the study of Roma lives and to the teaching of social anthropology at Saint Andrews, I invite you to confer the title of Master of Arts.

Tamara videosa. Yes, thank you. I call upon Doctor William Tooman of the School of Divinity. Vice Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, and most importantly, graduating students. Congratulations. Today is your day. Now the last time I had the pleasure of addressing a class of Happy Saint Andrews graduates, the theme of my speech was death. Keeping to tradition, I have striven to identify a similarly modeling topic for your day of Glory and joy. I thought long and I thought hard about topics like contagious disease and bankruptcy and toothache. But in the end I settled on a run of the mill graduation theme. The theme of ambition. As new graduates, you are freshers all over again, entering a new phase of life. Not knowing exactly how to go about it or what it will bring you. This comes with appropriate measure of uncertainty and anxiety, but most of you I'm sure will hope to excel to rise however slowly in position and prosperity. So you're probably expecting me to celebrate ambition. You are, I suspect, anticipating quotations like Emerson's pretentious adage, ambition is the germ from which all growth of nobleness proceeds. You might be bracing yourself for cliches like seize the day, or ambition is enthusiasm with a purpose. Ambition though is not a virtue. It is a force of character that leads many to success, but it is also the cause of many of the world's greatest ills. The need to get only to be getting the need for position only to have power. Ambition is not in itself good or bad. Let no one tell you you should be ambitious. Don't be fooled into thinking it will bring you health or well being or happiness. The unpleasant truth is that ambition has no fulfillment. There's no achievement that completes it, it just goes on and on. In some cultures, the endlessness of ambition identifies it as a vice rather than a virtue. Daoist proverbs, in this vein abound. There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition. There is no calamity greater than discontent. There is no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Put differently, ambition is the enemy of contentment, but contentment, good as it might be for your mental health, is not anymore a virtue than is ambition. The pursuit of contentment can be profoundly self-centered. It can lead to artificial prioritization of 1's personal good to the neglect of others. Protecting your time, your money, your health can be self defeating, causing you to live in a bubble of self with narrow horizons and comfortable habits. So what can you do if ambition and contentment are irrevocably intention? Which do you choose? Now twice already I've used the word virtue. For some of you, I imagine virtue is a word deserving only of a smirk. A self serving word. A word for suckers, a threadbare religious word. Fear not. I am not going to extol the virtues of virtue. I am not going to tell you to throw in your lot with the common good, whatever that might be, or to forego personal gain. I am going to tell you to choose contentment rather than ambition. Out of self interest. The happiest, most contented, least regretful people are those whose lives revolve around others. Striving to create happiness and connection and harmony and whatever other kindly word you choose, it's those people those who seek what's best for those around them who lead the most contented lives. So be selfish by acting selfless. I have a friend who started a niche publishing company many years ago. Early on he had grand ambitions for his one man shop. He wanted to grow and to command his corner of the marketplace, and as it grew into a three person shop and a ten person shop and eventually into a corporation, his ambitions changed. He began to use his company to give second chances to people damaged by the endless frictions of the corporate world. He began to give positions to people whose personal lives were in ruins. He began to see his prophets as a way to invest in people to lend a hand. These days his company's profits are redistributed to his employees and to the charities that they choose. Together, he's established a hardship fund to help extended family members of his employees. He's employed refugees. My friend still works very long hours, but he is one of the most centered and calm and dare I say it, contented people that I know we will. All of us have deathbed regrets. I doubt he will have as many as most of us. So why reject ambition? Because ironically, it will not serve you well. The late novelist David Foster Wallace said it more eloquently than I ever could. Worship power and you will end up feeling weak and afraid and you will need ever more power over others to numb your own fears. Worship intellect and you will end up feeling stupid and a fraud on the verge of being found out. If you worship money and things you will never have enough worship. Your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. On one level. We all know this stuff already. It's been codified in myths and proverbs and cliches and epigrams and parables. The whole trick is keeping this truth up front in our daily consciousness because the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil, or that they're sinful, it's that they're unconscious. If you, like me, are not a person who is naturally overflowing with loving kindness, it doesn't much matter. You don't have to be kind to act kind. A study conducted at Emory University some years ago asked subjects to wear digital recorders for days at a time, capturing every conversation. The results of this were astonishing, aware that they were being observed, test subjects were more empathetic, spent more time with other people, laughed more, and used the word I far less. In short, they became better people. Today is your day. May you use all your other days selfishly wherever you find yourself, whatever you find yourself doing if you dedicate your days to those around you, you will discover mysteriously, that you have dedicated them to yourselves. Please stand for the benediction. Grazia Domini Nostri Yeso Christie at Caritas Day at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, said communicus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen."
