this gathering which officially is a meeting of the sonatas academicals scholars become masters masters become doctors and new professors are inducted it is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honors transformation the ceremony marks a significant rite of passage in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before and that moment is witnessed by everyone here in the hall today saint andrews is equally a place of cherished tradition and bold transformation we are proud to be scotland 's first and most ancient university we are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for so i will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony the largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the confirment of degrees at masters and doctoral level we confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin with saint andrews tradition we call upon the deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and we can further degree with that in phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i've placed upon you this cap to most though we simply say yet super tape meaning and upon you too graduations are conferred by me as vice chancellor the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the breaks or trousers of one of this university 's most famous sixteenth century students john knox the major proponent of the reformation in scotland and author amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women so i'm quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had different origins and was purchased for the doctoral graduation in sixteen ninety six of sir john arbuthnot the celebrated scottish physician and satirist his cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the seventeenth century as you've heard the university of saint andrews is scotland 's oldest university as well as its best university world authority to grant degrees was awarded to the university in fourteen thirteen we have not always had a building so worthy of this spectacle as the younger hall where we are today graduation for many years took place in the old university library on south street as the university drew towards its quincentenary which was celebrated in nineteen eleven it became apparent that we lacked a building of sufficient scale for that and other such occasions the solution at the time of the quincentenary was an enormous marquee and that's a habit which you will see later today we haven't wholly abandoned however it was felt that her building more fitting the solemnity and magnificence of the university was required and in nineteen nineteen doctor james and mrs annie younger are the noted brewing family who lived in nearby mount melville made a donation that allowed the university to plan for this handsome building building work commenced in nineteen twenty three during james irvins principalship in overseeing the construction of the hall principal ervin deliberately ensured that it was set back thirty three feet from the frontage of north street so that it does not intrude upon the long vista looking up towards the cathedral it is APT that a building planned for the future of saint andrews is respectful to its past the younger hall was opened by the duchess of york later queen elizabeth the queen mother in nineteen twenty nine the intention behind this building has a further significance james and annie younger asked that it be a facility opened to the town of saint andrews as well as the university and we are proud that this dual focus is still honoured the ground floor is sprung for scottish country dancing and both university and townspeople have been known to enjoy a dashing white sergeant on its well worn timbers saint andrews is a place that gains its strength from its capacity to bring people together from across the town and across the globe and the younger wall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time we we reopen the hall after completing the project that as you will have

at the university of freiburg in germany in addition to her academic studies nina has engaged widely in extracurricular and voluntary activities supporting young people is clearly a particular passion for nina who in her third year as an undergraduate created with her friends an educational programme for school children entitled neuroscience for kids in a GPS this course which has since operated in nurseries and schools across fifth seeks to inspire an interest in psychology amongst children from an early age and its intelligent design and visible impact have meant that it has secured two rounds of funding from the university nina has also volunteered as a mentor for the university 's first chances in gateway projects whereby she offers support to incoming and prospective students to ensure that the transition to university is a smooth one this work complements her role as a senior student ambassador in which capacity she has welcomed hundreds of visitors to saint andrews nina has worked with and supported her peers at university too she has held leadership positions in a number of societies including the guide dog society and the teddy bear hospital society for which she is a volunteer driver in her second year nina founded the student society saved the elephants which she led for three years and in addition to these roles nina has organised mindfulness study skills and

school of mathematics and statistics vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen friends it's my great honour to give this address to our new graduates this morning well done you've done it congratulations all those hours spent listening to lectures working on assignments and practicals and tutorials and examples and filling your brain with the knowledge required to get you through those exams and it's all paid off and here you are now a graduate with the right to put two or three letters after your name to indicate that you're a bachelor or a master or for some of you are doctor you've earned the right to use those letters and the reputation of this great university to pursue success in your chosen area but suffix is aside let's take a moment to reflect on what you've actually learned while you've been here of course you've acquired a body of knowledge and skills on your specialist topic you now know about theories of cognition or computation carcinogenesis or clustering you've also learned important time management skills and how to produce high quality work on a tight deadline very importantly i expect you've picked up some life skills along the way you may have learned how to cook for yourself or how to get wine or coffee stains out of a carpet but the aspect i'd like to focus on and encourage you to nurture is is bigger than all of that the key skill that we've imparted to all of you is the ability to think critically and rationally on an issue you know how to gather information on a topic how to evaluate the quality of that information to synthesize it to come to a view and then communicate your findings to others this key skill is your new superpower hmm it will i hope make you immune to fake news and alternative facts it will equip you no i hope it will compel you to look beyond the everyday hubbub of daily news and social media to the real stories the important stories and there are important stories the climate emergency environmental pollution social injustice gender and racial discrimination and many others some of you may devote your lives to addressing part of these stories you may work for an environmental consultancy or on new accessible medical treatments or low carbon technologies or contributing one of many other ways even if this is not part of your future career i hope that all of you will at least keep informed about these important stories and take at least small actions to use your education to make this world a better place of course one thing you can do this next week if you're eligible is to vote i'm sure i have our current chancellor support even in his absence in that suggestion i'm actually on strike today so you're getting this address for nothing so why am i here then well like many academics i'm not very good at withdrawing our labour the strike is on the range of issues low pay for starting academics high workloads and pension cuts in fact this dispute gives you an excellent opportunity to use your new superpower and find out why we're on strike to get information from multiple sources and make up your own mind on the issue consider writing to the union if you think our strike is unjustified or to universities UK if you think it is justify it students are the lifeblood of this university so your voice will make a difference just to be clear this strike is a national dispute and this university has been generally very supportive over these issues which is one reason why i find it a great place to work and i hope you two have found it a great place to study actually while you've been hard at work studying over these past few years the university leadership in in consultation with the academic community has been hard at work itself coming up with a strategic vision to guide us through the next five years you may have come across a copy today or you can find it online our vision starts with the consideration of our social responsibilities and then has four themes world leading diverse global and entrepreneurial just like the university you two need a strategy to guide your decisions and if you don't have one already you could do worse than take your alma maters as a starting point world leading ever to excel i bet you've heard that before do the best you can diverse keep an open mind be inquisitive be aware of the implicit biases that can cloud our thinking global look beyond your own environment and consider the big picture entrepreneurial be flexible and adaptive take some risks but be resilient if things don't go to plan above all use your superpower as i said before students are the lifeblood of this university we've absolutely loved having you here to study with us and we hope that as well as picking up your new superpower you've loved your time with us obtaining a degree from the university of saint andrews is no mean feat and so on behalf of the university i congratulate you all well done please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri yesu christy at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sit kumon nebus nobis in the secular siculum amen",

ladies and gentlemen friends it's my great honour to give this address to our new graduates this morning well done you've done it congratulations all those hours spent listening to lectures working on assignments and practicals and tutorials and examples and filling your brain with the knowledge required to get you through those exams and it's all paid off and here you are now a graduate with the right to put two or three letters after your name to indicate that you're a bachelor or a master or for some of you are doctor you've earned the right to use those letters and the reputation of this great university to pursue success in your chosen area but suffix is aside let's take a moment to reflect on what you've actually learned while you've been here of course you've acquired a body of knowledge and skills on your specialist topic you now know about theories of cognition or computation carcinogenesis or clustering you've also learned important time management skills and how to produce high quality work on a tight deadline very importantly i expect you've picked up some life skills along the way you may have learned how to cook for yourself or how to get wine or coffee stains out of a carpet but the aspect i'd like to focus on and encourage you to nurture is is bigger than all of that the key skill that we've imparted to all of you is the ability to think critically and rationally on an issue you know how to gather information on a topic how to evaluate the quality of that information to synthesize it to come to a view and then communicate your findings to others this key skill is your new superpower hmm it will i hope make you immune to fake news and alternative facts it will equip you no i hope it will compel you to look beyond the everyday hubbub of daily news and social media to the real stories the important stories and there are important stories the climate emergency environmental pollution social injustice gender and racial discrimination and many others some of you may devote your lives to addressing part of these stories you may work for an environmental consultancy or on new accessible medical treatments or low carbon technologies or contributing one of many other ways even if this is not part of your future career i hope that all of you will at least keep informed about these important stories and take at least small actions to use your education to make this world a better place of course one thing you can do this next week if you're eligible is to vote i'm sure i have our current chancellor support even in his absence in that suggestion i'm actually on strike today so you're getting this address for nothing so why am i here then well like many academics i'm not very good at withdrawing our labour the strike is on the range of issues low pay for starting academics high workloads and pension cuts in fact this dispute gives you an excellent opportunity to use your new superpower and find out why we're on strike to get information from multiple sources and make up your own mind on the issue consider writing to the union if you think our strike is unjustified or to universities UK if you think it is justify it students are the lifeblood of this university so your voice will make a difference just to be clear this strike is a national dispute and this university has been generally very supportive over these issues which is one reason why i find it a great place to work and i hope you 2 have found it a great place to study actually while you've been hard at work studying over these past few years the university leadership in in consultation with the academic community has been hard at work itself coming up with a strategic vision to guide us through the next five years you may have come across a copy today or you can find it online our vision starts with the consideration of our social responsibilities and then has four themes world leading diverse global and entrepreneurial just like the university you two need a strategy to guide your decisions and if you don't have one already you could do worse than take your alma maters as a starting point world leading ever to excel i bet you've heard that before do the best you can diverse keep an open mind be inquisitive be aware of the implicit biases that can cloud our thinking global look beyond your own environment and consider the big picture entrepreneurial be flexible and adaptive take some risks but be resilient if things don't go to plan above all use your superpower as i said before students are the lifeblood of this university we've absolutely loved having you here to study with us and we hope that as well as picking up your new superpower you've loved your time with us obtaining a degree from the university of saint andrews is no mean feat and so on behalf of the university i congratulate you all well done please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri yesu christy at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sit kumon nebus nobis in the secular siculum amen",

      "display": "Good morning graduates, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Donald McEwen and I'm the chaplain to the university, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to this graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. On this exciting day for you. Presiding at today's graduation ceremony is the Vice Chancellor Professor Sally Mapstone. In a few moments, the academic procession will enter the hall to welcome the academic procession. Members of Syncopators Chapel Choir will lead us in singing the Gaudeamus Please do join in the words can be found in your program. At the end of the graduation ceremony, all our new graduates will join the academic procession, leaving the younger hall and walking along North Street and entering sense of Eighters quadrangle through the Archway. To supporters here, Please wait until all our new graduates have left the hall. Ushers will then show you to the nearest exits outside. You will be directed to the quad where you will be able to join our new graduates. Please ensure that your mobile phone is switched off and please remain seated throughout the ceremony and refrain from taking photographs or recordings of people not in your immediate group. To capture this unique moment, our official photographer will now take a photograph of those graduating today before the ceremony begins. It's a wonderful day. Let's see your wonderful smiles you're ready. There goes. Thank you. Thank you very much for your attention. I hope you enjoy the graduation ceremony. Please rise for the Gaudeamus.

Ed Price 13 Hope Quad Nunca Gary Dimauro, Opus Arte and Kipea ET Perte equipped. Tum Filiatrault Cotinus sanctum nomen tuum, glorificus at Misericordia to Avita Amiternum consequ periosteum christum dominum nostrum. Amen. Please be seated. Good morning everybody. I am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony. At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of the sonatas, academicals scholars become Masters, masters become doctors and new professors are inducted. It is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year, and it is a tradition that honors transformation. The ceremony marks a significant rite of passage, in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before, and that moment is witnessed by everyone here in the hall today. Saint Andrews is equally a place of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking. Important in all of this is that as we change, we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the confirment of degrees at Masters and doctoral level. We confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin with Saint Andrews tradition, we call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we can further degree with that in phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I've placed upon you this cap to most, though we simply say. Yet super tape meaning and upon you too. Graduations are conferred by me as Vice Chancellor. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the breaks or trousers of one of this university's most famous 16th century students, John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and author, amongst other things, of the first blast of the trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women. So I'm quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had different origins and was purchased for the doctoral graduation in 1696 of Sir John Arbuthnot, the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. His cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century. As you've heard, the University of Saint Andrews is Scotland's oldest university, as well as its best university. World Authority to grant degrees was awarded to the university in 1413. We have not always had a building so worthy of this spectacle as the younger hall where we are today graduation for many years took place in the old University Library on South St as the university drew towards its quincentenary, which was celebrated in 1911. It became apparent that we lacked a building of sufficient scale for that and other such occasions. The solution at the time of the Quincentenary was an enormous marquee, and that's a habit which you will see later today. We haven't wholly abandoned, however, it was felt that her building more fitting the solemnity and magnificence of the university was required, and in 1919, Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger are the noted brewing family who lived in nearby Mount. Melville made a donation that allowed the university to plan for this handsome. Building building work commenced in 1923 during James Irvins Principalship. In overseeing the construction of the hall, principal, Ervin deliberately ensured that it was set back 33 feet from the frontage of North St so that it does not intrude upon the Long Vista looking up towards the cathedral. It is APT that a building planned for the future of Saint Andrews is respectful to its past. The younger hall was opened by the Duchess of York. Later Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in 1929. The intention behind this building has a further significance. James and Annie Younger asked that it be a facility opened to the town of Saint Andrews, as well as the university and we are proud that this dual focus is still honoured. The ground floor is sprung for Scottish country dancing and both university and townspeople have been known to enjoy a dashing white Sergeant on its well worn Timbers. Saint Andrews is a place that gains its strength from its capacity to bring people together from across the town and across the globe and the younger wall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time. We we reopen the hall after completing the project that as you will have seen, has already begun to refit and reframe this cherished building. So now to return to today's ceremony. After students have been awarded their degrees and the Principal's medal has been presented, members have since our Vatas Chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the induction of new professors and the graduation address, which today will be delivered by Professor Len Thomas. The ceremony will close with the benediction by the University chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We are so pleased that all of you are here today to share in the success of our graduates. I hope that this is a memorable and happy day for all of you. Decanus faculty artist art school.

Congratulations once again to all our graduates. I should now like to introduce the principal's medal. This award was inaugurated 10 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by Eden Ravenscroft. Believed to be the oldest firm of Taylors and Ropemakers Rd makers in the world. The award of the Principles Medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at Saint Andrews. The awards were open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline. The achievements celebrated are academic, as well as sporting musical or other attainments. This morning we recognise Nina Ujvari Lakos, who has just received her Master of Science by research in psychology. Nina joined the University of Saint Andrews in 2014 and she first graduated in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Psychology. Neimus nomination references an outstanding undergraduate career in which he was placed on the Dean's list for outstanding academic achievement for each year of study. In addition to being awarded a first class degree and multiple prizes in her main disciplines, Nina also won awards for her performance. In astronomy and ecology at savannahs level, speaking to the breadth of her hard work and expertise. Nina continued absent Andrews to undertake the Master of Science degree, with which she's just graduated today, and I'm very pleased to recognise that she has just started a PhD in the field of pedagogical psychology at the University of Freiburg in Germany. In addition to her academic studies, Nina has engaged widely in extracurricular and voluntary activities. Supporting young people is clearly a particular passion for Nina, who in her third year as an undergraduate created with her friends an educational programme for school children entitled Neuroscience for Kids in a GPS. This course, which has since operated in nurseries and schools across 5th, seeks to inspire an interest in psychology amongst children from an early age and its intelligent design and visible impact have meant that it has secured. Two rounds of funding from the university. Nina has also volunteered as a mentor for the university's first chances in Gateway projects, whereby she offers support to incoming and prospective students to ensure that the transition to university is a smooth one. This work complements her role as a senior student ambassador, in which capacity she has welcomed hundreds of visitors to Saint Andrews. Nina has worked with and supported her peers at university too. She has held leadership positions in a number of societies, including the Guide Dog Society and the Teddy Bear Hospital Society, for which she is a volunteer driver. In her second year, Nina founded the Student Society, saved the elephants, which she led for three years, and in addition to these roles Nina has organised mindfulness study skills and career workshops for her peers, demonstrating her commitment not only. To her own success, but to that of the individuals around her, Nina, in recognition of all that you have achieved both academically and personally during your time as as an undergraduate.

This states you have been allotted Sparta. Do it credit. I call upon Professor Len Thomas of the School of Mathematics and Statistics. Vice Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen. Friends. It's my great honour to give this address to our new graduates this morning. Well done, you've done it, congratulations. All those hours. Spent listening to lectures, working on assignments and practicals and tutorials and examples and filling your brain with the knowledge required to get you through those exams. And it's all paid off. And here you are now a graduate with the right to put two or three letters after your name to indicate that you're a bachelor or a master. Or for some of you are doctor, you've earned the right to use those letters and the reputation of this great university to pursue success in your chosen. Area. But suffix is aside. Let's take a moment to reflect on what you've actually learned while you've been here. Of course, you've acquired a body of knowledge and skills on your specialist topic. You now know about theories of cognition or computation, carcinogenesis or clustering. You've also learned important time management skills and how to produce high quality work on a tight deadline. Very importantly, I expect you've picked up some life skills along the way. You may have learned how to cook for yourself or how to get wine or coffee stains out of a carpet. But the aspect I'd like to focus on and encourage you to nurture is is bigger than all of that. The key skill that we've imparted to all of you is the ability to think critically and rationally on an issue. You know how to gather information on a topic, how to evaluate the quality of that information to synthesize it, to come to a view, and then communicate your findings to others. This key skill is your new superpower, hmm. It will, I hope, make you immune to fake news and alternative facts. It will equip you. No, I hope it will compel you to look beyond the everyday hubbub of Daily News and social media to the real stories. The important stories. And there are important stories. The climate, emergency, environmental pollution, social injustice. Gender and racial discrimination and many others. Some of you may devote your lives to addressing part of these stories. You may work for an environmental consultancy or on new accessible medical treatments or low carbon technologies, or contributing one of many other ways. Even if this is not part of your future career, I hope that all of you will at least keep informed about these important stories. And take at least small actions to use your education to make this world a better place. Of course, one thing you can do this next week if you're eligible is to vote. I'm sure I have our current Chancellor support even in his absence in that suggestion. I'm actually on strike today. So you're getting this address for nothing. So why am I here then? Well? Like many academics, I'm not very good at withdrawing our labour. The strike is on the range of issues. Low pay for starting academics, high workloads, and pension cuts. In fact, this dispute gives you an excellent opportunity to use your new superpower and find out why we're on strike to get information from multiple sources and make up your own mind on the issue. Consider writing to the Union if you think our strike is unjustified or to Universities UK if you think it is, justify it. Students are the lifeblood of this university, so your voice will make a difference. Just to be clear, this strike is a national dispute, and this university has been generally very supportive over these issues, which is one reason why I find it a great place to work, and I hope you 2 have found it a great place to study. Actually, while you've been hard at work studying over these past few years, the university leadership in, in consultation with the academic community, has been hard at work itself. Coming up with a strategic vision to guide us through the next five years. You may have come across a copy today or you can find it online. Our vision starts with the consideration of our social responsibilities. And then has four themes. World leading diverse, global and entrepreneurial. Just like the university, you two need a strategy to guide your decisions, and if you don't have one already, you could do worse than take your alma maters as a starting point. World leading ever to excel. I bet you've heard that before. Do the best you can. Diverse, keep an open mind. Be inquisitive, be aware of the implicit biases that can cloud our thinking. Global look beyond your own environment and consider the big picture. Entrepreneurial be flexible and adaptive. Take some risks, but be resilient if things don't go to plan. Above all. Use your superpower. As I said before, students are the lifeblood of this university. We've absolutely loved having you here to study with us, and we hope that as well as picking up your new superpower you've loved your time with us. Obtaining a degree from the University of Saint Andrews is no mean feat. And so on. Behalf of the university, I congratulate you all. Well done. Please stand for the benediction. Grazia Domini Nostri Yesu, Christy at Caritas Day at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti sit Kumon, Nebus nobis in the secular siculum, Amen."
