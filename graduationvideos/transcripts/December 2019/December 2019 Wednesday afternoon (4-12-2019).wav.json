trump phonia tour cortana 's sanctum nomen tuum glorificus at misericordia to avita my turnham consequence or periosteum christum dominum nostrum ohmen please be seated good afternoon everybody i'm delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony at this gathering which officially is a meeting of the sonatas academicals scholars become masters masters become doctors and new professor will be inducted and people of distinction are honoured it is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition which honours transformation the ceremony marks a significant rite of passage in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before and that moment is shared by everyone in the hall here today saint andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation we are proud to be scotland 's first and most ancient university we are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for so i will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony at this point i would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate deanna nanny the largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at masters and doctoral level i should also like to note that today for the first time those we are graduating include twenty two scholars with degrees from our newly established graduate school for interdisciplinary studies the graduate school is a unique initiative as all of the postgraduate degree courses it offers are inherently interdisciplinary drawing upon expertise from across our academic community so welcome to the first cohort we will be conferring degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin in accordance with saint andrew 's tradition we call upon the deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and we then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say met super tay and meaning and upon you too graduations are conferred by me as vice chancellor the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the breaks or trousers of one of this university 's most famous sixteenth century students john knox the major proponent of the reformation in scotland and author amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women so i am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had different origins and was purchased for the doctoral graduation in sixteen ninety six of sir john arbuthnot the celebrated scottish physician and satirist his cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the seventeenth century as you have heard the university of saint andrews is scotland 's oldest university as well as its best university world authorities to grant degrees was awarded to the university in fourteen thirteen we have not always had a building so worthy of this spectacle as the younger hall where we are today graduation for many years took place in the old university library on south street as the university drew towards its quincentenary which was celebrated in nineteen eleven it became apparent that we lacked a building of sufficient scale for that and other such occasions the solution at the time of the quincentenary was an enormous marquee a habit which you will see later today we have not wholly abandoned however it was felt that a building more fitting the solemnity and magnificence of the university was required and in nineteen nineteen doctor james and mrs annie younger of the noted brewing family who lived in nearby mount melville made a donation that allowed the university to plan for this handsome building building work commenced in nineteen twenty three during james irvins principalship in overseeing the construction of the younger hall principal ervin deliberately ensured that it was set back thirty feet from the frontage of north street so that it does not intrude upon the long vista looking towards the cathedral it is APT that a building planned for the future of saint andrews is respectful of its past the younger hall was opened by the duchess of york later queen elizabeth the queen mother in nineteen twenty nine and the intention behind this building has a further significance james and annie younger asked that it be a facility opened to the town of saint andrews as well as the university and we are proud that this dual focus is still honoured the ground floor here is sprung for scottish country dancing and both university and townspeople have been known to enjoy a dashing white sergeant on its well worn timbers saint andrews is a place that gains its strength from its capacity to bring people together from across the town and indeed across the globe and the younger hall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time we reopen the hall after completing the project that as you can see has already begun to refit and refresh this cherished building to return now to today's ceremony after students are awarded their degrees members of saint servetas chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the induction of a new professor the confirment of an honorary doctorate on diana nami and the graduation address which today will be delivered by professor catherine o'leary the ceremony will close with the benediction by the university chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession graduation is the highlight of the

doctor of laws honoris kauser vienna nami rebel freedom fighter activist advocate role model influencer this is the enemy rihanna often tells the story of a young fourteen year old girl who was ejected from school in the town of sienna in kurdistan for throwing food at a teacher who accused her of being promiscuous this term before the iranian revolution was a multicultural one with kurdish jewish armenian and assyrian populations and it was actually briefly run by the kurdish democratic party of iran this was a town where once iranian women had voices and choices which inevitably incurred the wrath of the islamic militia the ana grew up in this town in a home environment where injustice was not acceptable and she could not stand by while iranian kurds in particular women began to lose their freedom and their rights to be heard to this end she joined the peshmerga and was a freedom fighter for twelve years until she became aware that her life and the life of her young daughter were in danger at this point she applied for and obtained asylum asylum in the UK moving to a then deprived area of london when sophia nadir the iraqi kurd translator who was helping to settle the anna 's daughter into school was killed by her husband and inlaws in a so called honour killing diana could not tolerate the fact that the violence was not prosecuted under the excuse of cultural differences in two thousand and two rihanna established the iranian and kurdish women 's rights organization the I K W R O and shortly afterwards in two thousand and three she launched the international campaign against honor killings the I K W R O is a vital charity with a permanent staff of seven seventeen and ten more volunteers altogether speaking ten different languages they provide advice up to some two thousand women per year as well as advocacy and referrals around five hundred women per year focusing on forced marriage child marriage sexual violence FGM and practical issues like housing and benefits but like diana their work is about the follow through about establishing partnerships working with local authorities and schools and training professionals since it's establishment the I K W R O has changed lives directly and indirectly through their high octane awareness raising through public engagement activities and championing which includes the establishment of the true honours awards the I K W R O and the anna quickly gained a claim for their work being named the best new voluntary sector organisation and earning the rising star award in two thousand and six these honors were just the first of many and more recently in twenty fourteen the anna received the special woman women on the move award by the UN HCR and in twenty fifteen was awarded woman of the year by red magazine her book girl with a gun written with karen atwood will be published in march twenty twenty rihanna is a positive role model who has empowered women across the world for example she's inspired the filmmaker dia khan director and producer of banaz a love story this is a rare film portraying an honor killing and one of the few times the men who raped and murdered were extradited to the UK and received life sentences throughout her life deanna has given voice to others she is an advocate for the unheard and if you ever need anyone on your side it is the fourteen year old food throwing girl from sienna liana nami vice chancellor for her pioneering work and unyielding activism for those who suffer injustice i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of laws on

my dream come true their principles chancellor and vice chancellor and everyone at saint andrew 's university thank you from the bottom of my heart it is a huge honour to be among such a brilliant people and to celebrate your hard work and achievements congratulations to you all on a personal lot graduating today marks the realization of a long of a lifelong dream just as i was to go to university my world was turned upside down when islamic regime took over the revolution of iranian people and attacked my homeland family and friends university had to wait as i joined kurdish peshmerga kurdish freedom fighter on the frontline to fight for freedom and equality although i never made made it to university i have had a very active life full of experiences both heartbreaking and wonderful and i have realized that i have never stopped learning i would like to take this opportunity to thank those who nominated me the judging panel all of my dear family friends and my colleagues at icro and everyone who helped me on my journey here and to wish everyone in this room the very best for your lifelong learning ahead thank you i call upon professor catherine o'leary of the school of modern languages vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen everyone i would like to congratulate you all on your achievement i'm honored to be here today to share this with you your families and your friends today is a day of celebration for yourselves and for those who have supported you looking around the whole today we can see a reflection of a small university set in a dramatically windswept corner of fife a community that is both scottish and international happily and resolutely so one that respects traditions and embraces new ideas one that encourages both compassion and bold action you are part of this cosmopolitan welcoming and open tradition i count myself lucky to be part of it too i stand here today as someone who came from another country to find a home here within this great academic community but also as a teacher who has enjoyed watching you grow in confidence and knowledge during your time here and as the proud supervisor of coronica and guadalupe two of today's PHD students graduates brother i work in modern languages in spanish and have spent much of my career focusing on the creative works mostly theatre that emerged despite the hostile circumstances of dictatorship and the silencing force of censorship when the press was not free and much news was fake the theatre became a sight of ideological battle i gathering place for those with alternative ideas and a space where hope could be both imagined and enacted the theatre literature and the arts and humanities more broadly help us to grapple with life 's challenges to attempt to understand its paradoxes and to celebrate its beauty the arts and humanities have given us many of our greatest most inspiring and most comforting achievements those of us who have the privilege of time to study these subjects know their value their creative social and yes definitely economic value they teach us to think about the technological advances and social and ethical challenges of our times and to find creative human centered responses to them you should therefore embrace your role as the imaginative and resourceful problem solvers of today's and tomorrow's society but it will not all be plain sailing on this day of celebrating academic success i also want to talk to you about failure like the dramatists i study whose goals were constantly frustrated by a dictatorship you will find that failure to achieve your objectives is part of life my colleagues and i hope that in addition to providing you with the skills to be successful in your chosen pathway we have also provided you with the skills to fail well as that international irishman samuel beckett said in his story worst word whole ever tried ever failed no matter try again fail again fail better i use this quote to mean and here i diverge from beckett that great explorer of the human condition whose sentiment was less optimistic that i hope we have equipped you with the capacity not to be daunted by failure but rather to have the ability to pick yourself up to go on to remain positive to try again to try something else today's achievement is of course both the end of something and a new beginning another step in a lifelong learning trajectory as you move on from your academic home in saint andrews we hope that your time here has served you well and will inspire you to be creative and resilient in facing life 's challenges and that you will play some role in shaping a future that is both just and happy congratulations again and enjoy this special day with your friends and families good luck and with apologies to samuel beckett i say to you not worst word hoe but best word hoe thank you please stand for the benediction gracia dominos yesu christie at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen",

influencer this is the enemy rihanna often tells the story of a young 14 year old girl who was ejected from school in the town of sienna in kurdistan for throwing food at a teacher who accused her of being promiscuous this term before the iranian revolution was a multicultural one with kurdish jewish armenian and assyrian populations and it was actually briefly run by the kurdish democratic party of iran this was a town where once iranian women had voices and choices which inevitably incurred the wrath of the islamic militia the ana grew up in this town in a home environment where injustice was not acceptable and she could not stand by while iranian kurds in particular women began to lose their freedom and their rights to be heard to this end she joined the peshmerga and was a freedom fighter for 12 years until she became aware that her life and the life of her young daughter were in danger at this point she applied for and obtained asylum asylum in the UK moving to a then deprived area of london when sophia nadir the iraqi kurd translator who was helping to settle the anna's daughter into school was killed by her husband and inlaws in a so called honour killing diana could not tolerate the fact that the violence was not prosecuted under the excuse of cultural differences in 2002 rihanna established the iranian and kurdish women's rights organization the IKWRO and shortly afterwards in 2003 she launched the international campaign against honor killings the IKWRO is a vital charity with a permanent staff of 717 and 10 more volunteers altogether speaking 10 different languages they provide advice up to some 2000 women per year as well as advocacy and referrals around 500 women per year focusing on forced marriage child marriage sexual violence FGM and practical issues like housing and benefits but like diana their work is about the follow through about establishing partnerships working with local authorities and schools and training professionals since it's establishment the IKWRO has changed lives directly and indirectly through their high octane awareness raising through public engagement activities and championing which includes the establishment of the true honours awards the IKWRO and the anna quickly gained a claim for their work being named the best new voluntary sector organisation and earning the rising star award in 2006 these honors were just the first of many and more recently in 2014 the anna received the special woman women on the move award by the UN HCR and in 2015 was awarded woman of the year by red magazine her book girl with a gun written with karen atwood will be published in march 2020 rihanna is a positive role model who has empowered women across the world for example she's inspired the filmmaker dia khan director and producer of banaz a love story this is a rare film portraying an honor killing and one of the few times the men who raped and murdered were extradited to the UK and received life sentences throughout her life deanna has given voice to others she is an advocate for the unheard and if you ever need anyone on your side it is the 14 year old food throwing girl from sienna liana nami vice chancellor

congratulations to you all on a personal lot graduating today marks the realization of a long of a lifelong dream just as i was to go to university my world was turned upside down when islamic regime took over the revolution of iranian people and attacked my homeland family and friends university had to wait as i joined kurdish peshmerga kurdish freedom fighter on the frontline to fight for freedom and equality although i never made made it to university i have had a very active life full of experiences both heartbreaking and wonderful and i have realized that i have never stopped learning i would like to take this opportunity to thank those who nominated me the judging panel all of my dear family friends and my colleagues at icro and everyone who helped me on my journey here and to wish everyone in this room the very best for your lifelong learning ahead thank you i call upon professor catherine o'leary of the school of modern languages vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen everyone i would like to congratulate you all on your achievement i'm honored to be here today to share this with you your families and your friends today is a day of celebration for yourselves and for those who have supported you looking around the whole today we can see a reflection of a small university set in a dramatically windswept corner of fife a community that is both scottish and international happily and resolutely so one that respects traditions and embraces new ideas one that encourages both compassion and bold action you are part of this cosmopolitan welcoming and open tradition i count myself lucky to be part of it too i stand here today as someone who came from another country to find a home here within this great academic community but also as a teacher who has enjoyed watching you grow in confidence and knowledge during your time here and as the proud supervisor of coronica and guadalupe two of today's PHD students graduates brother i work in modern languages in spanish and have spent much of my career focusing on the creative works mostly theatre that emerged despite the hostile circumstances of dictatorship and the silencing force of censorship when the press was not free and much news was fake the theatre became a sight of ideological battle i gathering place for those with alternative ideas and a space where hope could be both imagined and enacted the theatre literature and the arts and humanities more broadly help us to grapple with life's challenges to attempt to understand its paradoxes and to celebrate its beauty the arts and humanities have given us many of our greatest most inspiring and most comforting achievements those of us who have the privilege of time to study these subjects know their value their creative social and yes definitely economic value they teach us to think about the technological advances and social and ethical challenges of our times and to find creative human centered responses to them you should therefore embrace your role as the imaginative and resourceful problem solvers of today's and tomorrow's society but it will not all be plain sailing on this day of celebrating academic success i also want to talk to you about failure like the dramatists i study whose goals were constantly frustrated by a dictatorship you will find that failure to achieve your objectives is part of life my colleagues and i hope that in addition to providing you with the skills to be successful in your chosen pathway we have also provided you with the skills to fail well as that international irishman samuel beckett said in his story worst word whole ever tried ever failed no matter try again fail again fail better i use this quote to mean and here i diverge from beckett that great explorer of the human condition whose sentiment was less optimistic that i hope we have equipped you with the capacity not to be daunted by failure but rather to have the ability to pick yourself up to go on to remain positive to try again to try something else today's achievement is of course both the end of something and a new beginning another step in a lifelong learning trajectory as you move on from your academic home in saint andrews we hope that your time here has served you well and will inspire you to be creative and resilient in facing life's challenges and that you will play some role in shaping a future that is both just and happy congratulations again and enjoy this special day with your friends and families good luck and with apologies to samuel beckett i say to you not worst word hoe but best word hoe thank you please stand for the benediction gracia dominos yesu christie at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen",

      "display": "Good afternoon graduations, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Donald McEwen and I'm the chaplain to the university. It is my pleasure to welcome you today to this graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews on this exciting day for you.

I'm delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony. At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of the sonatas, academicals scholars become Masters, masters become doctors and new professor will be inducted and people of distinction are honoured. It is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year, and it is a tradition which honours transformation. The ceremony marks a significant rite of passage, in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before, and that moment is shared by everyone in the hall here today. Saint Andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking. Important in all of this is that as we change, we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. At this point I would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate Deanna Nanny. The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at Masters and doctoral level. I should also like to note that today for the first time those we are graduating include 22 scholars with degrees from our newly established Graduate School for Interdisciplinary Studies. The Graduate School is a unique initiative as all of the postgraduate degree courses it offers are inherently interdisciplinary, drawing upon expertise from across our academic community. So welcome to the first cohort. We will be conferring degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin, in accordance with Saint Andrew's tradition, we call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though we simply say. Met Super Tay and meaning and upon you too. Graduations are conferred by me as Vice Chancellor. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the breaks or trousers of one of this university's most famous 16th century students, John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and author, amongst other things, of the first blast of the trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women. So I am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this CAP actually had different origins and was purchased for the doctoral graduation in 1696 of Sir John Arbuthnot, the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. His cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century. As you have heard, the University of Saint Andrews is Scotland's oldest university, as well as its best university. World authorities to grant degrees was awarded to the university in 1413. We have not always had a building so worthy of this spectacle as the younger hall where we are today graduation for many years took place in the old University Library on South St. As the university drew towards its quincentenary, which was celebrated in 1911, it became apparent that we lacked a building of sufficient scale for that and other such occasions. The solution at the time of the Quincentenary was an enormous marquee, a habit which you will see later today. We have not wholly abandoned, however. It was felt that a building more fitting the solemnity and magnificence of the university, was required, and in 1919 Doctor James and Mrs Annie, Younger of the noted brewing family who lived in nearby Mount Melville, made a donation that allowed the university to plan for this handsome. Building building work commenced in 1923 during James Irvins Principalship. In overseeing the construction of the younger hall, principal, Ervin deliberately ensured that it was set back 30 feet from the frontage of North St so that it does not intrude upon the Long Vista looking towards the cathedral, it is APT that a building planned for the future of Saint Andrews is respectful of its past. The younger hall was opened by the Duchess of York. Later Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in 1929. And the intention behind this building has a further significance. James and Annie Younger asked that it be a facility opened to the town of Saint Andrews, as well as the university, and we are proud that this dual focus is still honoured. The ground floor here is sprung for Scottish country dancing and both university and townspeople have been known to enjoy a dashing white Sergeant on its well worn Timbers. Saint Andrews is a place that gains its strength from its capacity to bring people together from across the town, and indeed across the globe and the younger Hall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time we reopen the hall after completing the project that, as you can see, has already begun to refit and refresh this cherished building. To return now to today's ceremony, after students are awarded their degrees, members of Saint Servetas Chapel Choir will perform before we proceed to the induction of a new professor, the confirment of an honorary doctorate on Diana, Nami and the graduation address, which today will be delivered by Professor Catherine O'Leary. The ceremony will close with the benediction by the University chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We're delighted that you're all here to share in the success of our graduates and I hope that this is a really memorable and happy day for all of you. Decanus facultades arzum vice chancellor.

Rebel Freedom fighter activist advocate role model influencer. This is the enemy. Rihanna often tells the story of a young 14 year old girl who was ejected from school in the town of Sienna in Kurdistan for throwing food at a teacher who accused her of being promiscuous. This term before the Iranian revolution was a multicultural one with Kurdish, Jewish, Armenian, and Assyrian populations, and it was actually briefly run by the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran. This was a town where once Iranian women had voices and choices which inevitably incurred the wrath of the Islamic militia. The Ana grew up in this town in a home environment where injustice was not acceptable and she could not stand by. While Iranian Kurds, in particular women, began to lose their freedom and their rights to be heard. To this end, she joined the Peshmerga and was a freedom fighter for 12 years until she became aware that her life and the life of her young daughter were in danger. At this point, she applied for and obtained asylum asylum in the UK, moving to a then deprived area of London. When Sophia Nadir, the Iraqi Kurd translator who was helping to settle the Anna's daughter into school, was killed by her husband and Inlaws in a so called honour, killing Diana, could not tolerate the fact that the violence was not prosecuted. Under the excuse of cultural differences, in 2002, Rihanna established the Iranian and Kurdish women's rights organization, the IKWRO, and shortly afterwards, in 2003, she launched the International Campaign against Honor killings. The IKWRO is a vital charity with a permanent staff of 717 and 10 more volunteers. Altogether speaking 10 different languages. They provide advice up to some 2000 women per year. As well as advocacy and referrals. Around 500 women per year. Focusing on forced marriage, child marriage, sexual violence, FGM and practical issues like housing and benefits. But like Diana, their work is about the follow through about establishing partnerships, working with local authorities and schools, and training professionals. Since it's establishment, the IKWRO has changed lives directly and indirectly through their high octane awareness. Raising through public engagement activities and championing which includes the establishment of the True Honours awards. The IKWRO and the Anna quickly gained a claim for their work being named the best new voluntary sector organisation and earning the Rising Star Award in 2006. These honors were just the first of many, and more recently in 2014 the Anna received the special Woman Women on the Move award by the UN HCR and in 2015 was awarded Woman of the Year by Red Magazine. Her book girl with a gun written with Karen Atwood will be published in March 2020. Rihanna is a positive role model who has empowered women across the world. For example, she's inspired the filmmaker, Dia Khan, director and producer of Banaz. A love story. This is a rare film portraying an honor killing and one of the few times the men who raped and murdered were extradited to the UK and received life sentences. Throughout her life, Deanna has given voice to others. She is an advocate for the unheard, and if you ever need anyone on your side, it is the 14 year old food throwing girl from Sienna Liana Nami. Vice Chancellor for her pioneering work. And unyielding activism for those who suffer injustice.

Many congratulations Diane congratulations. Well. My dream come true. Their principles. Chancellor and vice chancellor. And everyone at Saint Andrew's University. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. It is a huge honour to be among such a brilliant. People and to celebrate your hard work. And achievements congratulations. To you all. On a personal lot, graduating today marks the realization. Of a long of a lifelong dream. Just as I was to go to university, my world was turned upside down when Islamic regime took over the revolution of Iranian people and attacked my homeland, family and friends. University had to wait. As I joined Kurdish Peshmerga, Kurdish freedom fighter on the frontline to fight for freedom and equality. Although I never made made it to university, I have had a very active life full of experiences both heartbreaking and wonderful. And I have realized that I have never stopped learning. I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who nominated me the judging panel. All of my dear family friends. And my colleagues at Icro and everyone who helped me on my journey here. And to wish everyone in this room. The very best for your lifelong learning ahead. Thank you. I call upon Professor Catherine O'Leary of the School of Modern Languages. Vice Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen everyone. I would like to congratulate you all on your achievement. I'm honored to be here today to share this with you, your families, and your friends. Today is a day of celebration for yourselves and for those who have supported you. Looking around the whole today we can see a reflection of a small university set in a dramatically windswept corner of Fife. A community that is both Scottish and international. Happily and resolutely so. One that respects traditions and embraces new ideas. One that encourages both compassion and bold action. You are part of this cosmopolitan welcoming and open tradition. I count myself lucky to be part of it too. I stand here today as someone who came from another country to find a home here within this great academic community. But also as a teacher who has enjoyed watching you grow in confidence and knowledge during your time here. And as the proud supervisor of Coronica and Guadalupe, two of today's PhD students. Graduates brother I work in modern languages in Spanish and have spent much of my career focusing on the creative works, mostly theatre. That emerged despite the hostile circumstances of dictatorship and the silencing force of censorship. When the press was not free and much news was fake, the theatre became a sight of ideological battle I gathering place for those with alternative ideas and a space where hope could be both imagined and enacted. The theatre literature and the Arts and humanities more broadly, help us to grapple with life's challenges, to attempt to understand its paradoxes and to celebrate its beauty. The Arts and humanities have given us many of our greatest, most inspiring, and most comforting achievements. Those of us who have the privilege of time to study these subjects know their value, their creative social, and yes, definitely economic value. They teach us to think about the technological advances and social and ethical challenges of our times and to find creative human centered responses to them. You should therefore embrace your role as the imaginative and resourceful problem solvers of today's and tomorrow's society. But it will not all be plain sailing. On this day of celebrating academic success. I also want to talk to you about failure. Like the dramatists, I study whose goals were constantly frustrated by a dictatorship. You will find that failure to achieve your objectives is part of life. My colleagues and I hope that in addition to providing you with the skills to be successful in your chosen pathway, we have also provided you with the skills to fail well. As that international Irishman Samuel Beckett said in his story, worst word whole. Ever tried ever failed no matter? Try again, fail again, fail better. I use this quote to mean and here I diverge from Beckett that great explorer of the human condition whose sentiment was less optimistic. That I hope we have equipped you with the capacity not to be daunted by failure, but rather to have the ability to pick yourself up to go on to remain positive, to try again, to try something else. Today's achievement is of course, both the end of something and a new beginning. Another step in a lifelong learning trajectory. As you move on from your academic home in Saint Andrews. We hope that your time here has served you well and will inspire you to be creative and resilient in facing life's challenges and that you will play some role in shaping a future that is both just and happy. Congratulations again and enjoy this special day with your friends and families. Good luck and with apologies to Samuel Beckett. I say to you not worst word hoe but best word hoe. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domino's Yesu Christie at Caritas Day at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum Amen."
