my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this virtual degree conferral ceremony for the twenty twenty one summer graduation at the university of saint andrews some of you will already have recognised that these proceedings are not taking place in the younger hall which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall is currently undergoing refurbishment to revitalize this venue for the use of future generations we are instead celebrating these rituals in parliament hall on south street avenue that refers to a much older tradition of graduation parliament hall and the chamber of bulls the king james library commenced construction in sixteen twelve to provide the university with its first proper library following increasing donations of books including around two hundred volumes from king james the sixth and first and it was completed in sixteen forty three parliament hall is so named because it housed the scottish parliament of sixteen forty five to sixteen forty six when parliament retreated to the safety of saint andrews whilst edinburgh and much of scotland were gripped by plague an apt parallel to our ongoing present circumstances graduation was hosted in the ceremonial space of parliament hall and in the king james library from at least sixteen ninety six until the early twentieth century the tradition of graduation extends back even further and has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century of all our traditions it is our most cherished and significant and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain to this day the core of the graduation ceremony is the conferral of degrees each graduate receives their degree and thus becomes a graduate transitioning from a member of our student community into the next stage of their life but while this ceremony is a practical one it is also a ritual of celebration at graduation we recognise the sustained endeavour our students have undertaken the commitment they have demonstrated to acquiring knowledge and the rewards they have gained the students who graduate today are radically different people from those who joined us as entrance so we also celebrate the journey they have come on the skills and friendships they have developed during their time in saint andrews and we offer thanks to the academics professional staff and family members and friends who have given them the support and encouragement necessary to reach this milestone i

this ceremony and it is my pleasure now to introduce our guest speaker hazel ervin who will congratulate our new graduates for the first time hazel was born in a maternity hospital in saint andrews on a site that has since been absorbed into the golf estate of the dukes course and these origins foreshadowed both an affinity with saint andrews and a pursuit of sporting excellence that has extended throughout her life as well as of course a love of golf hazel read for a master of arts in art history at the university of saint andrews receiving her degree in july nineteen eighty six and for over thirty years since she has been one of britain 's leading sports broadcasters renowned for her professionalism and continuously pushing boundaries as one of the first women to attain recognition in an industry which she has utterly transformed through example the breadth of hazell 's presenting commentating and hosting work is beyond measure hazel has worked for every major UK network and on each of their four most sports programmes covering wimbledon to ski sunday and sports from athletics to snooker hazel has also been a presenter and reporter for fifteen olympic games beginning with the nineteen eighty eight summer olympics in seoul and she carried the olympic flame in moscow ahead of the twenty fourteen winter games in sochi throughout her career hazel has returned unceasingly to golf on which she first presented in nineteen ninety two for BBC sport and she subsequently became the first woman to undertake the lead presentation role of the open championship often based at the old course here in town as well as the masters tournament in augusta hazel 's career has been recognised with several awards including the royal television society sports presenter of the year award in two thousand and seven and i am pleased to acknowledge that hazel has accepted the offer of an honorary doctorate from the university of saint andrews which will be awarded to her in person during the ceremonies next june let us turn now to hazel irvin who will deliver a message for our graduates hello and thank you principal mapstone for that most generous introduction hello two to all of the new graduates my fellow graduates of the university of saint andrews and to your friends and family today this year we're sharing this most special occasions on various laptops and screens around the world now last we can't yet share it together in the younger hole but i understand that plans are well established for those in person celebrations in better times next year and believe me that's one party you won't want to miss so whilst this may be a virtual graduation ceremony the achievement that underpins it and is recognized within it is authentic and is real it is your achievement i remember this day in my own life in fact it's exactly thirty five years since i received my certificate in it scroll saying the goudi one last time and stood off to try and find a job and i only realized how much time had passed since then when i recently tried to help my own daughter as she set out on her own exam path she'd stuck all kinds of coats up on her wall to try and get her in the mood to study hard you know the ones every achievement starts with the decision to try be awesome or don't bother the usual greeting card stuff but one of them really struck a chord with me it was a quote from nelson mandela which read it always seems impossible until it's done now as a sports broadcaster and journalist i've become used to quoting mister mandela but in the context of his observations about my great passion sport he said sport has the power to change the world and has the power to inspire it has the power to unite people in a way that little else can and it's my belief and lived experience that he was buying on about that and i hope the tokyo olympics this summer despite all of their challenges will prove him right once again but that other quote it always seems impossible until it's done spoke to me about the power of perseverance mister mandela knew a thing or two about that but so do you because these words also speak to us about your experiences over the last sixteen months during a time of global tumult and challenge you know thirty five years ago i remember my last year university of saint andrews very vividly i loved it but it was tough it was nerve wracking and it was stressful in fact it was the most challenging and demanding year i had ever faced in my young life to that point and yet you have done it during the most challenging and demanding year that any of us can remember in our lives it all seemed impossible for a while right you were largely denied access to your friends to lecture halls to the union to the pub to the sporting and extracurricular activities that are such a key part of being at university you've gone without so much of that OK some of you won't have missed the library very much but you've also been denied access to your friends and many of the fun times too and on top of that many of you will have tragically lost loved ones along the way in the last few months but how proud they would be of you right now on a day like today we've all lost some of the liberties that we once took for granted we've lost touch with people literally and figuratively and all of this has not been without cost mentally and physically to us either i couldn't have got through my final exams without my best pals at uni we helped one another through it we shared the load and my five best friends from uni are incidentally still my five best friends and i've no doubt that you have found a way to stay together with your friends too and you've helped one another over the last few months in short it's been a long slog you've done a whole academic year online and largely on your own you are the first group of graduates to have done so and i'm sure you would want me to thank the staff at the university of saint andrews for their part in helping to make it happen what a monumental effort it has been to give you the tools to complete your degrees the library staff you incredibly manage to put all of the books and you are reading material online the academic staff who've recorded lectures or spoke live to you on screen the administrative staff who kept the whole institution functioning and performing as the world class and world renowned university that this is what a team effort it has been and i remind you again of nelson mandela 's words it always seems impossible until it's done and you have done it and because of that you have become a key part of the most resilient of graduate cohorts ever produced by this university or any other you have got what sir alex ferguson called bounce back ability and you've proved yourself time and time again over the last few months to be adaptable tough and capable of much more than you ever thought was possible so when you eventually receive the twenty twenty one graduation certificate in the post it won't come with an asterisk above twenty twenty one seeing that you earned this during the darkest days of a global pandemic but perhaps it should but you will know and your future work colleagues and employers will know and they will recognize the new skills and spirit that you have garnered over the last sixteen months you have so much to offer and so much that you can now teach others so when life seems tough for you and others along the way after this you can always remember that it always seems impossible until it's done i wish you every success in the future and i am deeply honoured to have been involved in your graduation day to day thank you so very much to hazel for that rich and rewarding contribution i would like to invite our graduates to reflect on hazel 's message and their time at saint andrews during today's musical interlude performed by the chancellor 's piper alistair robinson a third year student reading for a master of arts in modern history at the university thank you to alistair robinson for that terrific performance as principal it now falls to me to deliver today's graduation address and it is customary to begin such remarks by offering wholehearted congratulations each of you our new graduates has every reason to be very proud of the degree you have earned and we the tutors staff family and friends who have helped you through are very proud of you a saint andrews degree is one of the finest that you can attain anywhere in the world and that means it is not easily earned but requires innumerable hours of concentrated study and hard work without which you would not have made it this far each day at the university will have reshaped you slightly because studying and the contemplation it entails demands that you consider new perspectives and fold them into your comprehension of the world i'm sure you will all have experienced the feeling of your brain expanding at some point either when deep into an essay observing the results of an experiment or listening to a particularly powerful lecture and that addictive sensation can inspire you to keep learning throughout your life one of your fellow alumni anne carson a professor of classics and renowned poet describes how in this act of thinking the mind must reach across this space between known and unknown linking one to the other these graduation rituals serve in part to reminders that this broadening of the mind 's reach has made those of you who have just received degrees entirely different people from those who arrived to pursue them our congratulations are owed to you more than most it is almost a year and a half since the pandemic reshaped the way we live and work and we have each felt some measure of difficulty in response to the challenges it has presented that is most acutely felt by those amongst us who have lost loved ones but people untouched by grief have reckoned with physical separation from friends and loved ones and resultant feelings of loneliness as students you have also forgone many of the conventional university experiences of your final year i want to recognize the superlative acumen and resilience you have demonstrated the way our student body has responded to the pandemic and the community building activities have been inspirational it is such a privilege to lead an institution at which each person has demonstrated integrity and responsibility in the face of previously unimaginable challenges and i'm truly thankful to each of you whilst our present time is one absolutely unto itself analogies to the universities perseverance tell us things on which it is beneficial to reflect overtime you will come to see this period as one incredible phase in your lifetime but one that you can take and use to shape the rest of your life positively and for your own and others good a hundred and ten years ago in september nineteen eleven the university celebrated its five hundredth anniversary the proceedings were overseen by the then principal professor sir james donaldson who had at that time led the university through twenty five years of growth and the ensuing sense of prosperity inspired anniversary events of jubilation and no small expense the centrepiece was an adversary ceremony attended by over three thousand five hundred people including representatives of over a hundred and forty five universities and learned societies and which was complemented by quintessential saint andrew and activities such as symposia theatrical productions and torchlit processions this era of prosperity was curtailed by the onset of the first world war in nineteen fourteen doctor norman reed a historian of our university reports that our student population declined by thirty percent between nineteen twelve and nineteen fifteen and that of the around one thousand graduate students and staff who served in trench warfare a hundred and thirty died in action whilst many more suffered internment or lasting health difficulties meanwhile those staff and students who remained at saint andrews were requisitioned into the war effort much as in the current pandemic our staff worked throughout the UK to render their skills both practical and theoretical to the national effort and academics provided insight into many of the health logistical and strategic challenges of the time the laboratories of the butte medical school were reoriented to research materials with the potential for military weaponization including mustard gas and the chemistry laboratories of the united college were recast to meet medical demands central to this wartime research was james irvin later sir james a professor of chemistry who subsequently served as principal and vice chancellor of the university for over three decades from nineteen twenty one until his death in nineteen fifty two those decades are renowned as some of the most transformative in our history because sir james was determined to rebuild the university after the war and develop it into the institution of global renown that it is today yet ervin was a student at our university much like any of today's graduates who excelled and changed the landscape of our town physically and metaphorically through simple determination and commitment james was born in glasgow and developed an early passion for chemistry at school before successfully applying to be a research assistant to professor thomas purdy a chemist of distinction at saint andrews recalling his arrival to saint andrews in october eighteen ninety five aged eighteen oven remarked i stood amazed beneath saint salvatore's tower and i knew i had come home a sentiment many of you will share irvin matriculated as a student in eighteen ninety six with purdeys encouragement and read chemistry with zoology physics and botany whilst continuing to work as an assistant he graduated in march eighteen ninety eight as a decorated scholar and having revelled in the delights of our town including runs along west sands dinners with friends and ambles along the beaches at sunset marvin's path took him away from saint andrews he moved to leipzig to pursue doctoral research and it was in germany that he met his future wife mabel williams from belfast but training in leipzig as a musician evan returned to saint andrews in nineteen oh one where he was joined by mabel whom he married in nineteen oh five and he established himself as a researcher of global renown in the field of carbohydrate chemistry marvin's years in leipzig were funded by scholarship provision and his time as an early career researcher at saint andrews was underwritten by support from the carnegie trust for the universities of scotland both of which are tuned him to the transformative utility of philanthropy twenty twenty one marks one hundred years since irving 's assumption of the principal ship and his legacy can be felt around us both physically and culturally irvine led the expansion of our subject offerings and student numbers increased accordingly from just over three hundred fifty students in nineteen fifteen to over one thousand students in the nineteen thirties and with a drastically increased proportion of women these new students required new homes and irvine led the fundraising for and development of some of our finest halls of residence to compensate for the squalor of his own student accommodation years earlier his tenure saw the redevelopment of chatham house later expanded to become mcintosh hall as well as the building of since sylvatus hall he led the development of the younger hall which opened in nineteen twenty nine as well as the redevelopment of saint salvator 's chapel the former student union on north street and many other university properties across the estate irving paired this physical reconstitution of our university with an overhaul of its reputation and he became known globally as an academic ambassador for saint andrews but also for british higher education more broadly crucially establishing in particular many of the links with north america that we continue to enjoy today the vision courage and love for saint andrews that ervine exemplified gave shape to our town over a lifetime and have established a lasting legacy all of us have the power to do that including you who are just starting sir james has certainly inspired me throughout my tenure in his role as a former principal but also as an exemplar of the commitment to excellence that is ubiquitous at our university and which we have sought to instill in each of you during your time here his example has adopted new resonance since the inception of the pandemic and the steadfastness he exhibited during the war and the determination with which he sought to rebuild in its conclusion are instructive for all of us at our present historical juncture over a long career sir james never stopped thinking what he could do for the university that would improve its standing and the experience of its students and its staff ever to excel was emblematized by him across his life and it can be by you in yours in whatever you go on to do sir james exemplified one further thing to which each of us can attest the knowledge and belief that one goes on being a saint andrean right throughout one 's life wherever you are viewing this from and wherever your path may lead from here you are always welcome back to our town and i invite you all to stand beneath since arvato 's tower before too long and know you too have come home oremus grazia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular

who will congratulate our new graduates for the first time hazel was born in a maternity hospital in saint andrews on a site that has since been absorbed into the golf estate of the dukes course and these origins foreshadowed both an affinity with saint andrews and a pursuit of sporting excellence that has extended throughout her life as well as of course a love of golf hazel read for a master of arts in art history at the university of saint andrews receiving her degree in july 1986 and for over 30 years since she has been one of britain's leading sports broadcasters renowned for her professionalism and continuously pushing boundaries as one of the first women to attain recognition in an industry which she has utterly transformed through example the breadth of hazell's presenting commentating and hosting work is beyond measure hazel has worked for every major UK network and on each of their four most sports programmes covering wimbledon to ski sunday and sports from athletics to snooker hazel has also been a presenter and reporter for 15 olympic games beginning with the 1988 summer olympics in seoul and she carried the olympic flame in moscow ahead of the 2014 winter games in sochi throughout her career hazel has returned unceasingly to golf on which she first presented in 1992 for BBC sport and she subsequently became the first woman to undertake the lead presentation role of the open championship often based at the old course here in town as well as the masters tournament in augusta hazel's career has been recognised with several awards including the royal television society sports presenter of the year award in 2007 and i am pleased to acknowledge that hazel has accepted the offer of an honorary doctorate from the university of saint andrews which will be awarded to her in person during the ceremonies next june let us turn now to hazel irvin who will deliver a message for our graduates hello and thank you principal mapstone for that most generous introduction hello 2 to all of the new graduates my fellow graduates of the university of saint andrews and to your friends and family today this year we're sharing this most special occasions on various laptops and screens around the world now last we can't yet share it together in the younger hole but i understand that plans are well established for those in person celebrations in better times next year and believe me that's one party you won't want to miss so whilst this may be a virtual graduation ceremony the achievement that underpins it and is recognized within it is authentic and is real it is your achievement i remember this day in my own life in fact it's exactly 35 years since i received my certificate in it scroll saying the goudi one last time and stood off to try and find a job and i only realized how much time had passed since then when i recently tried to help my own daughter as she set out on her own exam path she'd stuck all kinds of coats up on her wall to try and get her in the mood to study hard you know the ones every achievement starts with the decision to try be awesome or don't bother the usual greeting card stuff but one of them really struck a chord with me it was a quote from nelson mandela which read it always seems impossible until it's done now as a sports broadcaster and journalist i've become used to quoting mr mandela but in the context of his observations about my great passion sport he said sport has the power to change the world and has the power to inspire it has the power to unite people in a way that little else can and it's my belief and lived experience that he was buying on about that and i hope the tokyo olympics this summer despite all of their challenges will prove him right once again but that other quote it always seems impossible until it's done spoke to me about the power of perseverance mr mandela knew a thing or two about that but so do you because these words also speak to us about your experiences over the last 16 months during a time of global tumult and challenge you know 35 years ago i remember my last year university of saint andrews very vividly i loved it but it was tough it was nerve wracking and it was stressful in fact it was the most challenging and demanding year i had ever faced in my young life to that point and yet you have done it during the most challenging and demanding year that any of us can remember in our lives it all seemed impossible for a while right you were largely denied access to your friends to lecture halls to the union to the pub to the sporting and extracurricular activities that are such a key part of being at university you've gone without so much of that OK some of you won't have missed the library very much but you've also been denied access to your friends and many of the fun times too and on top of that many of you will have tragically lost loved ones along the way in the last few months but how proud they would be of you right now on a day like today we've all lost some of the liberties that we once took for granted we've lost touch with people literally and figuratively and all of this has not been without cost mentally and physically to us either i couldn't have got through my final exams without my best pals at uni we helped one another through it we shared the load and my 5 best friends from uni are incidentally still my 5 best friends and i've no doubt that you have found a way to stay together with your friends too and you've helped one another over the last few months in short it's been a long slog you've done a whole academic year online and largely on your own you are the first group of graduates to have done so and i'm sure you would want me to thank the staff at the university of saint andrews for their part in helping to make it happen what a monumental effort it has been to give you the tools to complete your degrees the library staff you incredibly manage to put all of the books and you are reading material online the academic staff who've recorded lectures or spoke live to you on screen the administrative staff who kept the whole institution functioning and performing as the world class and world renowned university that this is what a team effort it has been and i remind you again of nelson mandela's words it always seems impossible until it's done and you have done it and because of that you have become a key part of the most resilient of graduate cohorts ever produced by this university or any other you have got what sir alex ferguson called bounce back ability and you've proved yourself time and time again over the last few months to be adaptable tough and capable of much more than you ever thought was possible so when you eventually receive the 2021 graduation certificate in the post it won't come with an asterisk above 2021 seeing that you earned this during the darkest days of a global pandemic but perhaps it should but you will know and your future work colleagues and employers will know and they will recognize the new skills and spirit that you have garnered over the last 16 months you have so much to offer and so much that you can now teach others so when life seems tough for you and others along the way after this you can always remember that it always seems impossible until it's done i wish you every success in the future and i am deeply honoured to have been involved in your graduation day to day thank you so very much to hazel for that rich and rewarding contribution i would like to invite our graduates to reflect on hazel's message and their time at saint andrews during today's musical interlude performed by the chancellor's piper alistair robinson a third year student reading for a master of arts in modern history at the university thank you to alistair robinson for that terrific performance as principal it now falls to me to deliver today's graduation address and it is customary to begin such remarks by offering wholehearted congratulations each of you our new graduates has every reason to be very proud of the degree you have earned and we the tutors staff family and friends who have helped you through are very proud of you a saint andrews degree is one of the finest that you can attain anywhere in the world and that means it is not easily earned but requires innumerable hours of concentrated study and hard work without which you would not have made it this far each day at the university will have reshaped you slightly because studying and the contemplation it entails demands that you consider new perspectives and fold them into your comprehension of the world i'm sure you will all have experienced the feeling of your brain expanding at some point either when deep into an essay observing the results of an experiment or listening to a particularly powerful lecture and that addictive sensation can inspire you to keep learning throughout your life one of your fellow alumni anne carson a professor of classics and renowned poet describes how in this act of thinking the mind must reach across this space between known and unknown linking 1 to the other these graduation rituals serve in part to reminders that this broadening of the mind's reach has made those of you who have just received degrees entirely different people from those who arrived to pursue them our congratulations are owed to you more than most it is almost a year and a half since the pandemic reshaped the way we live and work and we have each felt some measure of difficulty in response to the challenges it has presented that is most acutely felt by those amongst us who have lost loved ones but people untouched by grief have reckoned with physical separation from friends and loved ones and resultant feelings of loneliness as students you have also forgone many of the conventional university experiences of your final year i want to recognize the superlative acumen and resilience you have demonstrated the way our student body has responded to the pandemic and the community building activities have been inspirational it is such a privilege to lead an institution at which each person has demonstrated integrity and responsibility in the face of previously unimaginable challenges and i'm truly thankful to each of you whilst our present time is 1 absolutely unto itself analogies to the universities perseverance tell us things on which it is beneficial to reflect overtime you will come to see this period as one incredible phase in your lifetime but one that you can take and use to shape the rest of your life positively and for your own and others good 110 years ago in september 1911 the university celebrated its 500th anniversary the proceedings were overseen by the then principal professor sir james donaldson who had at that time led the university through 25 years of growth and the ensuing sense of prosperity inspired anniversary events of jubilation and no small expense the centrepiece was an adversary ceremony attended by over 3500 people including representatives of over 145 universities and learned societies and which was complemented by quintessential st andrew and activities such as symposia theatrical productions and torchlit processions this era of prosperity was curtailed by the onset of the first world war in 1914 doctor norman reed a historian of our university reports that our student population declined by 30% between 1912 and 1915 and that of the around 1000 graduate students and staff who served in trench warfare 130 died in action whilst many more suffered internment or lasting health difficulties meanwhile those staff and students who remained at saint andrews were requisitioned into the war effort much as in the current pandemic our staff worked throughout the UK to render their skills both practical and theoretical to the national effort and academics provided insight into many of the health logistical and strategic challenges of the time the laboratories of the butte medical school were reoriented to research materials with the potential for military weaponization including mustard gas and the chemistry laboratories of the united college were recast to meet medical demands central to this wartime research was james irvin later sir james a professor of chemistry who subsequently served as principal and vice chancellor of the university for over 3 decades from 1921 until his death in 1952 those decades are renowned as some of the most transformative in our history because sir james was determined to rebuild the university after the war and develop it into the institution of global renown that it is today yet ervin was a student at our university much like any of today's graduates who excelled and changed the landscape of our town physically and metaphorically through simple determination and commitment james was born in glasgow and developed an early passion for chemistry at school before successfully applying to be a research assistant to professor thomas purdy a chemist of distinction at saint andrews recalling his arrival to saint andrews in october 1895 aged 18 oven remarked i stood amazed beneath st salvatore's tower and i knew i had come home a sentiment many of you will share irvin matriculated as a student in 1896 with purdeys encouragement and read chemistry with zoology physics and botany whilst continuing to work as an assistant he graduated in march 1898 as a decorated scholar and having revelled in the delights of our town including runs along west sands dinners with friends and ambles along the beaches at sunset marvin's path took him away from saint andrews he moved to leipzig to pursue doctoral research and it was in germany that he met his future wife mabel williams from belfast but training in leipzig as a musician evan returned to saint andrews in 1901 where he was joined by mabel whom he married in 1905 and he established himself as a researcher of global renown in the field of carbohydrate chemistry marvin's years in leipzig were funded by scholarship provision and his time as an early career researcher at saint andrews was underwritten by support from the carnegie trust for the universities of scotland both of which are tuned him to the transformative utility of philanthropy 2021 marks 100 years since irving's assumption of the principal ship and his legacy can be felt around us both physically and culturally irvine led the expansion of our subject offerings and student numbers increased accordingly from just over 350 students in 1915 to over 1000 students in the 1930s and with a drastically increased proportion of women these new students required new homes and irvine led the fundraising for and development of some of our finest halls of residence to compensate for the squalor of his own student accommodation years earlier his tenure saw the redevelopment of chatham house later expanded to become mcintosh hall as well as the building of since sylvatus hall he led the development of the younger hall which opened in 1929 as well as the redevelopment of saint salvator's chapel the former student union on north street and many other university properties across the estate irving paired this physical reconstitution of our university with an overhaul of its reputation and he became known globally as an academic ambassador for saint andrews but also for british higher education more broadly crucially establishing in particular many of the links with north america that we continue to enjoy today the vision courage and love for saint andrews that ervine exemplified gave shape to our town over a lifetime and have established a lasting legacy all of us have the power to do that including you who are just starting sir james has certainly inspired me throughout my tenure in his role as a former principal but also as an exemplar of the commitment to excellence that is ubiquitous at our university and which we have sought to instill in each of you during your time here his example has adopted new resonance since the inception of the pandemic and the steadfastness he exhibited during the war and the determination with which he sought to rebuild in its conclusion are instructive for all of us at our present historical juncture over a long career sir james never stopped thinking what he could do for the university that would improve its standing and the experience of its students and its staff ever to excel was emblematized by him across his life and it can be by you in yours in whatever you go on to do sir james exemplified one further thing to which each of us can attest the knowledge and belief that one goes on being a st andrean right throughout one's life wherever you are viewing this from and wherever your path may lead from here you are always welcome back to our town and i invite you all to stand beneath since arvato's tower before too long and know you too have come home

Good morning, it is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this virtual degree conferral ceremony for the 2021 summer graduation at the University of Saint Andrews. Some of you will already have recognised that these proceedings are not taking place in the younger hall, which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929. The younger hall is currently undergoing refurbishment. To revitalize this venue for the use of future generations. We are instead celebrating these rituals in Parliament Hall on South St Ave that refers to a much older tradition of graduation. Parliament Hall and the Chamber of Bulls. The King James Library commenced construction in 1612 to provide the university with its first proper library, following increasing donations of books including around 200 volumes from King James the 6th and 1st, and it was completed in 1643. Parliament Hall is so named because it housed the Scottish Parliament of 1645 to 1646, when Parliament retreated to the safety of Saint Andrews, whilst Edinburgh and much of Scotland were gripped by plague. An apt parallel to our ongoing present circumstances. Graduation was hosted in the ceremonial space of Parliament Hall and in the King James Library from at least 1696 until the early 20th century. The tradition of graduation extends back even further and has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century. Of all our traditions, it is our most cherished and significant and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain to this day. The core of the graduation ceremony is the conferral of degrees. Each graduate receives their degree and thus becomes a graduate transitioning from a member of our student community into the next stage of their life. But while this ceremony is a practical one, it is also a ritual of celebration at graduation. We recognise the sustained endeavour our students have undertaken, the commitment they have demonstrated to acquiring knowledge, and the rewards they have gained. The students who graduate today are radically different people from those who joined us as entrance. So we also celebrate the journey they have come on. The skills and friendships they have developed during their time in Saint Andrews. And we offer thanks to the academics, professional staff and family members and friends who have given them the support and encouragement necessary to reach this milestone. I recognize that this virtual conferral ceremony is not in the format that our students envisaged because of continuing restrictions which limit our capacity to host large gatherings. But you are graduating class are to be commended. For over a year, your classes, assessments, and research projects have taken place virtually and only in person where possible. Each of you has adjusted brilliantly and resourcefully to these circumstances and in a time of great isolation. For many, you have fostered unity and connection, demonstrating the resilience of the Saint Andrews spirit and the strength of the ties that connect us. However separate we may be. Today's conferral ceremony allows us formally to award your degrees an important step in allowing you to move on to the world of work or further study. But for those of you who wish to participate in a traditional ceremony, we will welcome you and your families to Saint Andrews for an in person graduation event when it is safe for us to gather again. We have commenced planning for three successive weeks of graduation celebrations in June 2022, which will host the graduating class of 2022 alongside the returning classes of 2020 and 2021 who were not able to complete this ritual in person. It will be an immensely sweet occasion when we can celebrate together our physical separation does not detract from the significance of the graduation rights. To recognize the Felicity and formality of this ritual, we have preserved in this virtual format, many core elements of our graduation tradition. The first of these you have already witnessed as St Salvator's Chapel Choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As principal and Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to preside over these ceremonies and to provide this welcome and in a few minutes the university's chancellor. The right honourable Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will add his own words of congratulation. Following the introductions, we will proceed to the conferral of degrees upon students at bachelors, masters and doctoral level. I will call upon the Dean of the respective faculty and ask them to present each graduand for their award. The Dean will read the name of each student, and I will bestow the degree upon them in absentia with Latin phrases, according to our tradition. As one example, to confer degrees of Master of Arts, I will use the words AOS, absentees, magistro's, artsiom, renuncio. Which translates to, I announce that they have received the degree of Master of Arts in absentia. This is the precise moment at which each graduand becomes a graduate. At these ceremonies it is tradition that the university invites guests of honour to address our new graduates, inspire them, and wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives. I am very pleased that today's guest speaker is Hazel Irvin, an alumna of our university and a broadcaster, sports commentator and writer of global renown. Hazel has kindly recorded a graduation message for you, each to reflect on and we are honoured to have her contribute to our proceedings. A musical interlude will follow Hazel's words, after which I will deliver the graduation address to close our proceedings. The ceremony will formally conclude with the benediction and a musical contribution from the Chancellor's piper Alistair Robinson here, in Saint Andrews. The teachers and staff who have supported you are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 608 years and who support one another in the present. So while you are graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. It is our sincere hope that you will return next year to celebrate your graduation in person with your friends and family, academics and professional staff, and that you will continue to engage as a St Andrean throughout your life. I'm now pleased to introduce the Chancellor of the University of Saint Andrews, the right Honourable Lord Campbell of Pittenweem. Thank you, principal. One of the privileges of being Chancellor of this great university. Is the duty of conferring degrees personally upon those who are graduating today, but these are not normal times. And the fact that we meet at all, even if only virtually. Is the result of the remarkable efforts and commitment. Of the staff of this university, at all levels. Whether they be academic. Administrative or providing services and all of this under the leadership of the principal and her senior colleagues. To all of them, I extend our thanks. Today, as you graduate, you will formally become members of the academic family of Scotland's oldest university, a rare privilege, but one which you richly deserve. But that privilege brings with it both opportunity and responsibility. Because you will also become an ambassador for the university. An ambassador for its values wherever you go and whatever you do. We hope that we have made an impression upon you. Because you have certainly made an impression upon us. You'll always be welcome here. But today you go with our blessing. Our good wishes and our congratulations. Thank you to the chancellor for those generous words of wisdom and congratulation. We will now proceed to the main part of today's ceremony.

That concludes the presentation of awards for this ceremony. And it is my pleasure now to introduce our guest speaker, Hazel Ervin, who will congratulate our new graduates for the first time. Hazel was born in a maternity hospital in Saint Andrews on a site that has since been absorbed into the golf estate of the Dukes course. And these origins foreshadowed both an affinity with Saint Andrews and a pursuit of sporting excellence that has extended throughout her life as well as, of course, a love of golf. Hazel read for a Master of Arts in Art history at the University of Saint Andrews, receiving her degree in July 1986 and for over 30 years since she has been one of Britain's leading sports broadcasters. Renowned for her professionalism and continuously pushing boundaries as one of the first women to attain recognition in an industry which she has utterly transformed through example. The breadth of Hazell's presenting, commentating and hosting work is beyond measure. Hazel has worked for every major UK network and on each of their four most sports programmes covering Wimbledon to ski Sunday and sports from athletics to snooker. Hazel has also been a presenter and reporter for 15 Olympic Games, beginning with the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, and she carried the Olympic flame in Moscow ahead of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. Throughout her career, Hazel has returned unceasingly to golf on which she first presented in 1992 for BBC Sport, and she subsequently became the first woman to undertake the lead presentation role of the Open Championship, often based at the old course here in town as well as the Masters tournament in Augusta. Hazel's career has been recognised with several awards including the Royal Television Society, sports presenter of the Year award in 2007 and I am pleased to acknowledge that Hazel has accepted the offer of an honorary doctorate from the University of Saint Andrews, which will be awarded to her in person during the ceremonies next June. Let us turn now to Hazel Irvin, who will deliver a message for our graduates. Hello and thank you, principal Mapstone for that most generous introduction. Hello 2 to all of the new graduates my fellow graduates of the University of Saint Andrews and to your friends and family today. This year we're sharing this most special occasions on various laptops and screens around the world. Now last we can't yet share it together in the younger hole, but I understand that plans are well established for those in person celebrations in better times next year, and believe me, that's one party you won't want to miss. So whilst this may be a virtual graduation ceremony, the achievement that underpins it and is recognized within it is authentic and is real. It is your achievement. I remember this day in my own life. In fact, it's exactly 35 years since I received my certificate in it scroll saying the goudi one last time and stood off to try and find a job, and I only realized how much time had passed since then. When I recently tried to help my own daughter as she set out on her own exam path, she'd stuck all kinds of coats up on her wall to try and get her in the mood to study hard. You know, the ones every achievement starts with the decision to try, be awesome or don't bother. The usual greeting card stuff, but one of them really struck a chord with me. It was a quote from Nelson Mandela, which read it always seems impossible until it's done. Now as a sports broadcaster and journalist, I've become used to quoting Mr Mandela, but in the context of his observations about my great passion sport, he said, sport has the power to change the world and has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else can. And it's my belief. And lived experience that he was buying on about that. And I hope the Tokyo Olympics this summer, despite all of their challenges, will prove him right once again. But that other quote, it always seems impossible until it's done. Spoke to me about the power of perseverance. Mr Mandela knew a thing or two about that, but so do you. Because these words also speak to us about your experiences over the last 16 months during a time of global tumult and challenge. You know 35 years ago I remember my last year, University of Saint Andrews very vividly. I loved it, but it was tough. It was nerve wracking and it was stressful. In fact, it was the most challenging and demanding year I had ever faced in my young life to that point. And yet you have done it during the most challenging and demanding year that any of us can remember in our lives. It all seemed impossible for a while, right? You were largely denied access to your friends to lecture halls, to the Union to the pub. To the sporting and extracurricular activities that are such a key, part of being at university, you've gone without so much of that. OK, some of you won't have missed the library very much, but you've also been denied access to your friends and many of the fun times too. And on top of that, many of you will have tragically lost loved ones along the way in the last few months. But how proud they would be of you right now, on a day like today. We've all lost some of the liberties that we once took for granted. We've lost touch with people, literally and figuratively. And all of this has not been without cost mentally and physically to us either. I couldn't have got through my final exams without my best pals at uni. We helped one another through it we shared the load and my 5 best friends from Uni are incidentally still my 5 best friends. And I've no doubt that you have found a way to stay together with your friends too, and you've helped one another over the last few months. In short, it's been a long slog. You've done a whole academic year online and largely on your own. You are the first group of graduates to have done so. And I'm sure you would want me to thank the staff at the University of Saint Andrews for their part in helping to make it happen. What a monumental effort it has been to give you the tools to complete your degrees. The library staff you incredibly manage to put all of the books and you are reading material online. The academic staff who've recorded lectures or spoke live to you on screen. The administrative staff who kept the whole institution functioning and performing as the world class. And world renowned university that this is what a team effort it has been. And I remind you again of Nelson Mandela's words. It always seems impossible until it's done and you have done it. And because of that you have become a key part of the most resilient of graduate cohorts ever produced by this university or any other you have got what Sir Alex Ferguson called Bounce back ability, and you've proved yourself. Time and time again. Over the last few months to be adaptable, tough and capable of much more than you ever thought was possible. So when you eventually receive the 2021 graduation certificate in the post, it won't come with an* above 2021. Seeing that you earned this during the darkest days of a global pandemic, but perhaps it should. But you will know and your future work colleagues and employers will know and they will recognize the new skills and spirit that you have garnered over the last 16 months. You have so much to offer and so much that you can now teach others. So when life seems tough for you and others along the way after this, you can always remember that it always seems impossible until it's done. I wish you every success in the future and I am deeply honoured to have been involved in your graduation day to day. Thank you so very much to Hazel for that rich and rewarding contribution. I would like to invite our graduates to reflect on Hazel's message and their time at Saint Andrews during today's musical interlude performed by the Chancellor's Piper Alistair Robinson, a third year student reading for a Master of Arts in modern history at the university. Thank you to Alistair Robinson for that terrific performance. As principal, it now falls to me to deliver today's graduation address. And it is customary to begin such remarks by offering wholehearted congratulations. Each of you, our new graduates, has every reason to be very proud of the degree you have earned and we, the tutors, staff, family and friends who have helped you through are very proud of you. A Saint Andrews degree is one of the finest that you can attain anywhere in the world, and that means it is not easily earned, but requires innumerable hours of concentrated study and hard work, without which you would not have made it this far. Each day at the university will have reshaped you slightly, because studying and the contemplation it entails demands that you consider new perspectives and fold them into your comprehension of the world. I'm sure you will all have experienced the feeling of your brain expanding at some point, either when deep into an essay observing the results of an experiment or listening to a particularly powerful lecture and that addictive sensation can inspire you to keep learning throughout your life. One of your fellow alumni, Anne Carson, a professor of classics and renowned poet, describes how in this act of thinking the mind must reach across this space between known and unknown. Linking 1 to the other. These graduation rituals serve in part to reminders that this broadening of the mind's reach has made. Those of you who have just received degrees entirely different people from those who arrived to pursue them. Our congratulations are owed to you more than most. It is almost a year and a half since the pandemic reshaped the way we live and work, and we have each felt some measure of difficulty in response to the challenges it has presented. That is most acutely felt by those amongst us who have lost loved ones. But people untouched by grief have reckoned with physical separation from friends and loved ones, and resultant feelings of loneliness. As students you have also forgone many of the conventional university experiences of your final year. I want to recognize the superlative acumen and resilience you have demonstrated. The way our student body has responded to the pandemic and the Community building activities have been inspirational. It is such a privilege to lead an institution at which each person has demonstrated integrity and responsibility in the face of previously unimaginable challenges. And I'm truly thankful to each of you. Whilst our present time is 1 absolutely unto itself, analogies to the universities perseverance tell us things on which it is beneficial to reflect. Overtime you will come to see this. As one incredible phase in your lifetime, but one that you can take and use to shape the rest of your life positively and for your own and others good. 110 years ago, in September 1911, the University celebrated its 500th anniversary. The proceedings were overseen by the then principal Professor, Sir James Donaldson, who had at that time led the university through 25 years of growth and the ensuing sense of prosperity inspired anniversary events of jubilation, and no small expense. The centrepiece was an adversary ceremony attended by over 3500 people, including representatives of over 145 universities and learned societies and which was complemented by quintessential St. Andrew and activities. Such as symposia theatrical productions and torchlit processions. This era of prosperity was curtailed by the onset of the First World War in 1914. Doctor Norman Reed, a historian of our university, reports that our student population declined by 30% between 1912 and 1915 and that of the around 1000 graduate students and staff who served in trench warfare 130 died in action, whilst many more suffered internment or lasting health difficulties. Meanwhile, those staff and students who remained at Saint Andrews were requisitioned into the war effort, much as in the current pandemic. Our staff worked throughout the UK to render their skills, both practical and theoretical, to the national effort and academics provided insight into many of the health, logistical, and strategic challenges of the time. The laboratories of the Butte Medical School were reoriented to research materials with the potential for military weaponization, including mustard gas and the chemistry laboratories of the United College were recast to meet medical demands. Central to this wartime research was James Irvin, later Sir James, a professor of chemistry, who subsequently served as principal and Vice Chancellor of the University for over 3 decades, from 1921 until his death in 1952. Those decades are renowned as some of the most transformative in our history, because Sir James was determined to rebuild the university after the war and develop it into the institution of global renown, that it is today. Yet Ervin was a student at our university, much like any of today's graduates who excelled and changed the landscape of our town, physically and metaphorically through simple determination and commitment. James was born in Glasgow and developed an early passion for chemistry at school before successfully applying to be a research assistant to Professor Thomas Purdy, a chemist of distinction at Saint Andrews. Recalling his arrival to Saint Andrews in October 1895, aged 18. Oven remarked. I stood amazed beneath St Salvatore's tower, and I knew I had come home, a sentiment many of you will share. Irvin matriculated as a student in 1896 with Purdeys encouragement and read chemistry with zoology, physics and botany whilst continuing to work as an assistant. He graduated in March 1898 as a decorated scholar and having revelled in the delights of our town, including runs along West Sands dinners with friends and ambles along the beaches at sunset. Marvin's path took him away from Saint Andrews. He moved to Leipzig to pursue doctoral research, and it was in Germany that he met his future wife, Mabel Williams, from Belfast, but training in Leipzig as a musician. Evan returned to Saint Andrews in 1901, where he was joined by Mabel, whom he married in 1905, and he established himself as a researcher of global renown in the field of carbohydrate chemistry. Marvin's years in Leipzig were funded by scholarship provision and his time as an early career researcher at Saint Andrews was underwritten by support from the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, both of which are tuned him to the transformative utility of philanthropy. 2021 marks 100 years since Irving's assumption of the principal ship. And his legacy can be felt around us both physically and culturally. Irvine led the expansion of our subject offerings and student numbers increased accordingly from just over 350 students in 1915 to over 1000 students in the 1930s and with a drastically increased proportion of women. These new students required new homes and Irvine led the fundraising for and development of some of our finest halls of residence to compensate for the squalor of his own student accommodation years earlier. His tenure saw the redevelopment of Chatham House, later expanded to become McIntosh Hall, as well as the building of since Sylvatus Hall. He led the development of the younger hall, which opened in 1929, as well as the redevelopment of Saint Salvator's Chapel. The former student union on North Street and many other university properties across the estate. Irving paired this physical reconstitution of our university with an overhaul of its reputation, and he became known globally as an academic ambassador for Saint Andrews, but also for British higher education. More broadly, crucially, establishing in particular many of the links with North America that we continue to enjoy today. The vision, courage and love for Saint Andrews that Ervine exemplified gave shape to our town over a lifetime and have established a lasting legacy. All of us have the power to do that, including you who are just starting. Sir James has certainly inspired me throughout my tenure in his role as a former principal, but also as an exemplar of the commitment to excellence that is ubiquitous at our university and which we have sought to instill in each of you during your time here. His example has adopted new resonance since the inception of the pandemic, and the steadfastness he exhibited during the war and the determination with which he sought to rebuild in its conclusion, are instructive for all of us at our present historical juncture. Over a long career, Sir James never stopped thinking what he could do for the university that would improve its standing and the experience of its students and its staff. Ever to Excel was emblematized by him across his life and it can be by you in yours in whatever you go on to do. Sir James exemplified one further thing to which each of us can attest the knowledge and belief that one goes on being a St andrean right throughout one's life. Wherever you are viewing this from and wherever your path may lead from here, you are always welcome back to our town, and I invite you all to stand beneath since Arvato's tower before too long and know you too have come home. Oremus Grazia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi, at Caritas de, at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum, omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen."
