nostrum ahmed good afternoon it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this virtual degree conferral ceremony for the twenty twenty winter graduation at the university of saint andrews some of you will already have recognized that these proceedings are not taking place in the younger hall which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall is currently undergoing refurbishment to revitalize this venue for use of future generations we are instead celebrating these rituals in parliament hall on south street avenue which refers to a much older tradition of graduation parliament hall and the chamber above the king james library commenced construction in sixteen twelve to provide the university with its first proper library following increasing donations of books including around two hundred volumes from king james the sixth and first and it was completed in sixteen forty three parliament hall is so named because it housed the scottish parliament of sixteen forty five to sixteen forty six when parliament retreated to the safety of saint andrews whilst edinburgh and much of scotland were gripped by plague an apt parallel to our present circumstances graduation was hosted in the ceremonial space of parliament hall and in the king james library from at least sixteen ninety six until the early twentieth century the tradition of graduation extends back even further and has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century of all our traditions it is our most cherished and significant and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain to this day the core of the graduation ceremony is the conferral of degrees each graduand receives their degree and thus becomes a graduate transitioning from a member of our student community into the next stage of their life but while this ceremony is a practical one it is also a ritual of celebration at graduation we recognize the sustained endeavour our students have undertaken the commitment they have demonstrated to acquiring knowledge and the rewards they have gained the students who graduate today are radically different people from those who joined us as entrance O we also celebrate the journey they have come on the skills and friendships they have developed during their time in saint andrews and we offer thanks to the academics professional staff and family members and friends who have given them the support and encouragement necessary to reach this milestone i recognize that this virtual conferral ceremony is not in the format that our students envisaged because of ongoing restrictions which limit our capacity to host large gatherings but you are graduating class are to be commended over the past few months your classes assessments and research projects have taken place both in person but also often virtually each of you has adjusted brilliantly and resourcefully to these circumstances and in a time of great isolation for many you have fostered unity and connection demonstrating the resilience of the saint andrews spirit and the strength of the ties that connect us however separate we may be today's conferral ceremony allows us formally to award your degrees an important step in allowing you to move on to the world of work or further study but for those of you who wish to participate in a traditional ceremony we will welcome you and your families to saint andrews for an in person graduation event when it is safe for us to gather again it will be an immensely sweet occasion when we can celebrate together a physical separation does not detract from the significance of the graduation rights to recognise the felicity and formality of this ritual we have preserved in this virtual format many core elements of our graduation tradition the first of these you have already witnessed as saint salvatore chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as principal and vice chancellor it is my privilege to preside over these ceremonies and to provide this welcome and in a few minutes the university 's chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will add his own words of congratulation following the introductions we will proceed to the conferral of degrees upon students at bachelors masters and doctoral level i will call upon the dean of the respective faculty and ask them to present each graduate for their award the dean will read the name of each student and i will bestow the degree upon them in absentia with latin phrases according to our tradition as one example to confer the degree of master of arts i would use the words aos absenteeism registros artsiom renuncio which translates to announce that they have received the degree of master of arts in absentia this is the precise moment at which each graduand becomes a graduate at these ceremonies it is tradition that the university invites guests of honor to address our new graduates inspires them and wishes them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and i'm very pleased that today's speaker is the university 's fifty fourth rector doctor laila hussein OBE doctor hussein assumed this role on the first of november after her election by the student body earlier this semester and this is the first time she will address our student body in that capacity doctor hussain is a psychotherapist and a renowned activist for women

graduation message for you each to reflect on and we are honored to have our contribute to our proceedings after the rector 's words i will deliver the graduation address following which the ceremony will close with the benediction and musical contributions from the university organist tom wilkinson and the chancellor 's piper alistair robinson here in saint andrews the teachers and staff who have

interlude in the form of a recording made earlier this year as part of the saint andrews voices festival despite the challenges of rehearsing in dispersed settings the choir led by their director claire innes hopkins continued to deliver beautiful performances and we are so pleased to turn to them now as part of our proceedings my son john bonnie bray voice no it's love tired employee body see dance second screen school thank you to the choir for that magesterial contribution it brings me great pleasure now to introduce the fifty fourth rector of the university of saint andrews doctor laila hussein obiee to speak to our new graduates hello everyone i'm laila hussein the newly elected rector and i have the privilege of being the first congratulate you on your graduation so let me start by saying many many congratulations and i wish we could all be together to celebrate in person but the fact that we cannot be together does not remove how special this occasion is and i hope you are all celebrating with family friends in a safe and enjoyable way i know that the cohort which has graduated includes undergraduates receiving their first degree master students who have completed further studies and doctoral students who have just attained the highest possible level of academic qualifications well done to you all whatever stage of study you have completed you now have a banksy new degree titles which can confidently add to your email signature twitter bio you know sometime soon hopefully in your business cards and you should not be shy in doing this you won't extremely hard and deserve such credit this is my first time formally addressing the student 's body since assuming the role as director on november first and i would like to say how honored i am to have been welcomed into your community it is clear to me that saint andrews this special plays full of special students and i feel incredibly grateful that i'll be able to work alongside you for the next few years this may sound a bit outdated given that most of you are about to take your next steps outside of saint andrews however something that became clear to me when the election results was announced in that finishing studies at saint andrews is by no means or prevalent to the end of your journey with the university in the weeks following the election i received messages of support from people around the world from brazil to cameroon united arab emirates italy portugal here in scotland in the UK just to name a few so whilst san andrews is relatively small university and town compared to my hometown in london it is clearly a cosmopolitan global and modern university we are all lucky to belong in this community community means different things to different people i feel like i'm part of a community when i'm surrounded by people who support me who encourage me to achieve my goals i'm thankful to be surrounded by friends colleagues students who make me feel this way very often but being part of a community is not just by receiving but it's also giving it's reciprocal you can take support when you need it but you must also return it and ultimately you must work with a greater good in mind i'm sure i'm sure you all have your own communities in mind whether this is your with your family or friends or sport or society or people you share values and principles with community has never been more important this year which has been full of challenges so many of us are i know we'll all have felt this way during your academic work which will have been harder during the pandemic some of you may have experienced financial difficulties losses or part time jobs too and i admit that mental health for all of us has been affected all of us and has made a rapid changes rapid changes around this is happening as we speak some of us have coped better than others our communities support us in these times even when we cannot meet in person by enabling us to rise to these challenges and overcome them to seek help when needed to give help when it's required by others and as a result to ensure that we will overcome our difficulties together i know you already support each other so well in at saint andrews one of the things i want to focus on as a rector is a co creation community driven solution to the obstacles we are collectively facing it's very important we do that together that is after all the only way to make meaningful changes when we all participate so once you're leaving the community of active students in saint andrews you're transitioning into another the community of the former staff students around you around the world who keep in touch with one another and with the university at most times that community would always would be there to support you and you are very fortunate indeed to belong to such group as you enter your new work places universities clubs etc as you as as you join your new communities are hope you take with you what you have learned in saint andrews your commitment to shared progress support and excellence and in turn to be best member of those communities that you can be again congratulations to all of you thank you very much to doctor laila hussein for that memorable contribution i will now add some remarks of my own to conclude today's ceremony and here i speak directly to our new graduates for whom my first message is one of emphatic congratulations the degree you have received was not easily earned it acknowledges months or years of hard work focus and discipline but you have triumphed and you are now a saint andrews graduate nobody can take that accomplishment away from you i recognize that your cohort in particular has overcome unique challenges since march the covid nineteen pandemic has as we all know radically affected the way each of us lives and works you are the first generation of students in my lifetime who have been unable to browse the university of saint andrews library shelves or even when the pandemic first struck access study space or laboratories research requires concentration over a long period and you have sustained this while adapting to radically shifting circumstances and varying access to resources you have special cause to be proud of the way you have overcome these difficulties research by its very nature makes you adaptable it requires you to think round issues to consider a variety of sources or inputs and to innovate in order to attain results it requires mental agility your graduating class has needed to demonstrate a much higher capacity for adaptation than many which have gone before it and you are as a result extraordinarily capable people you can perform highly whilst traversing uncharted terrain you are dynamic and fortitude anous you have the capability to confront challenges and to overcome them those are indispensable skills because your lives will be filled with challenges you will face tasks and projects in the workplace to which you will need to step U you will face upheavals in your personal life although i hope these are few in number you will find that you can draw on the resilience the invention the hope and the new companionship which you have built and exhibited in the past few months you have got through these times and they will become an important part of you as the place in which you experience them will too your experiences and skills mean that as graduates you have the ability to address these challenges when they arise and to identify the wider societal issues which stand to benefit from interventions by people with your education and expertise the challenges you choose to confront are up to you as are the ways you confront them you can run for public office or like doctor hussain found a charity alternatively you can integrate small acts of kindness or advocacy into your daily life i know that this is a significant request it takes audacity to enact change and it is certainly much easier to do nothing but helping others is a nobler way to use your education and leads to a more fulfilling life meeting these lofty standards requires courage and inspiration models for which can be found at every turn a source of continual inspiration to me is nelson mandela known to you all as the first black president of the republic of south africa a road he assumed after twenty seven years of incarceration as a consequence of his retaliation against an oppressive apartheid regime mandela 's legacy is recorded in his writing most notably the long walk to freedom which i wholeheartedly recommend to you all and in the many dramatizations of his life foremost amongst these is the two thousand nine film invictus directed by clint eastwood and starring morgan freeman as nelson mandela it dramatizes mandela 's first term in office and charts his efforts to foster interracial alliances and partnerships in a country marked by the legacies of apartheid mandela exercised an almost unimaginable capacity to forgive the white citizens of south africa who persecuted him if i cannot change when circumstances demand it how can i expect others to mandela says in invictus these are words to live by the title of the film invictus is derived from a poem of the same name written in eighteen seventy five by the victorian poet william ernest henley who received an honorary doctorate from the university of saint andrews in eighteen ninety three it is a short poem four stanzas and sixteen lines in total and many of you will be familiar with its closing stanza it matters not how straight the gate how charged with punishments the screw i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul henry 's poem expresses the uncontrollability of resilience and determination and a conviction that one can and must overcome the challenges one faces despite their scale one can see why mandela found it to be such a source of potent inspiration he memorized its lines and during his time at robben island prison recited the poem to himself and his fellow prisoners the poem has since assumed an enormous cultural legacy particularly in the civil rights movement it served also as inspiration to the late congressman john lewis and it was read by barack obama at the memorial service for mandela in south africa upon his death in december two thousand and thirteen the film invictus depicts mandela 's efforts to build an interracial alliance with francois pienaar captain of the springboks south africa 's national rugby union team we find another link here because francois pienaar visited saint andrews at the end of two thousand seventeen alongside fellow rugby player sean fitzpatrick and footballer lilian thuram a triad of world champions who were advocating for the power of sport to improve life for people around the world in invictus mandela gives the poem to francois and he says we need inspiration francois because in order to build our nation we must all exceed our own expectations your time in saint andrews has served as a source of inspiration and it will go on doing so throughout your lives but you must see can find other sources of inspiration whether that is in artistic works real world events like mandela 's story or in the example set by your fellow students graduates and family members models for inspiration can be found everywhere identifying what inspires you will hold you in good stead as you strive to make a difference it will in mandela 's parlance enable you to exceed your own expectations for saint andrews student that translates to the belief that inspiration will enable you ever to excel i speak on behalf of your tutors your peers and your families when i say that you are people with boundless potential so take today to celebrate your successes you have earned that right but tomorrow look around identify your inspirations and hold these in mind as you move forward with the knowledge that you have the ability to affect great change you are the master of your fate do with it what you should oremus grazia domini nostri yasuke christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in

your community it is clear to me that saint andrews this special plays full of special students and i feel incredibly grateful that i'll be able to work alongside you for the next few years this may sound a bit outdated given that most of you are about to take your next steps outside of saint andrews however something that became clear to me when the election results was announced in that finishing studies at saint andrews is by no means or prevalent to the end of your journey with the university in the weeks following the election i received messages of support from people around the world from brazil to cameroon united arab emirates italy portugal here in scotland in the UK just to name a few so whilst san andrews is relatively small university and town compared to my hometown in london it is clearly a cosmopolitan global and modern university we are all lucky to belong in this community community means different things to different people i feel like i'm part of a community when i'm surrounded by people who support me who encourage me to achieve my goals i'm thankful to be surrounded by friends colleagues students who make me feel this way very often but being part of a community is not just by receiving but it's also giving it's reciprocal you can take support when you need it but you must also return it and ultimately you must work with a greater good in mind i'm sure i'm sure you all have your own communities in mind whether this is your with your family or friends or sport or society or people you share values and principles with community has never been more important this year which has been full of challenges so many of us are i know we'll all have felt this way during your academic work which will have been harder during the pandemic some of you may have experienced financial difficulties losses or part time jobs too and i admit that mental health for all of us has been affected all of us and has made a rapid changes rapid changes around this is happening as we speak some of us have coped better than others our communities support us in these times even when we cannot meet in person by enabling us to rise to these challenges and overcome them to seek help when needed to give help when it's required by others and as a result to ensure that we will overcome our difficulties together i know you already support each other so well in at saint andrews one of the things i want to focus on as a rector is a co creation community driven solution to the obstacles we are collectively facing it's very important we do that together that is after all the only way to make meaningful changes when we all participate so once you're leaving the community of active students in saint andrews you're transitioning into another the community of the former staff students around you around the world who keep in touch with one another and with the university at most times that community would always would be there to support you and you are very fortunate indeed to belong to such group as you enter your new work places universities clubs etc as you as as you join your new communities are hope you take with you what you have learned in saint andrews your commitment to shared progress support and excellence and in turn to be best member of those communities that you can be again congratulations to all of you thank you very much to doctor laila hussein for that memorable contribution i will now add some remarks of my own to conclude today's ceremony and here i speak directly to our new graduates for whom my first message is one of emphatic congratulations the degree you have received was not easily earned it acknowledges months or years of hard work focus and discipline but you have triumphed and you are now a saint andrews graduate nobody can take that accomplishment away from you i recognize that your cohort in particular has overcome unique challenges since march the COVID-19 pandemic has as we all know radically affected the way each of us lives and works you are the first generation of students in my lifetime who have been unable to browse the university of saint andrews library shelves or even when the pandemic first struck access study space or laboratories research requires concentration over a long period and you have sustained this while adapting to radically shifting circumstances and varying access to resources you have special cause to be proud of the way you have overcome these difficulties research by its very nature makes you adaptable it requires you to think round issues to consider a variety of sources or inputs and to innovate in order to attain results it requires mental agility your graduating class has needed to demonstrate a much higher capacity for adaptation than many which have gone before it and you are as a result extraordinarily capable people you can perform highly whilst traversing uncharted terrain you are dynamic and fortitude anous you have the capability to confront challenges and to overcome them those are indispensable skills because your lives will be filled with challenges you will face tasks and projects in the workplace to which you will need to step U you will face upheavals in your personal life although i hope these are few in number you will find that you can draw on the resilience the invention the hope and the new companionship which you have built and exhibited in the past few months you have got through these times and they will become an important part of you as the place in which you experience them will too your experiences and skills mean that as graduates you have the ability to address these challenges when they arise and to identify the wider societal issues which stand to benefit from interventions by people with your education and expertise the challenges you choose to confront are up to you as are the ways you confront them you can run for public office or like doctor hussain found a charity alternatively you can integrate small acts of kindness or advocacy into your daily life i know that this is a significant request it takes audacity to enact change and it is certainly much easier to do nothing but helping others is a nobler way to use your education and leads to a more fulfilling life meeting these lofty standards requires courage and inspiration models for which can be found at every turn a source of continual inspiration to me is nelson mandela known to you all as the first black president of the republic of south africa a road he assumed after 27 years of incarceration as a consequence of his retaliation against an oppressive apartheid regime mandela's legacy is recorded in his writing most notably the long walk to freedom which i wholeheartedly recommend to you all and in the many dramatizations of his life foremost amongst these is the 2009 film invictus directed by clint eastwood and starring morgan freeman as nelson mandela it dramatizes mandela's first term in office and charts his efforts to foster interracial alliances and partnerships in a country marked by the legacies of apartheid mandela exercised an almost unimaginable capacity to forgive the white citizens of south africa who persecuted him if i cannot change when circumstances demand it how can i expect others to mandela says in invictus these are words to live by the title of the film invictus is derived from a poem of the same name written in 1875 by the victorian poet william ernest henley who received an honorary doctorate from the university of saint andrews in 1893 it is a short poem 4 stanzas and 16 lines in total and many of you will be familiar with its closing stanza it matters not how straight the gate how charged with punishments the screw i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul henry's poem expresses the uncontrollability of resilience and determination and a conviction that one can and must overcome the challenges one faces despite their scale one can see why mandela found it to be such a source of potent inspiration he memorized its lines and during his time at robben island prison recited the poem to himself and his fellow prisoners the poem has since assumed an enormous cultural legacy particularly in the civil rights movement it served also as inspiration to the late congressman john lewis and it was read by barack obama at the memorial service for mandela in south africa upon his death in december 2013 the film invictus depicts mandela's efforts to build an interracial alliance with francois pienaar captain of the springboks south africa's national rugby union team we find another link here because francois pienaar visited st andrews at the end of 2017 alongside fellow rugby player sean fitzpatrick and footballer lilian thuram a triad of world champions who were advocating for the power of sport to improve life for people around the world in invictus mandela gives the poem to francois and he says we need inspiration francois because in order to build our nation we must all exceed our own expectations your time in saint andrews has served as a source of inspiration and it will go on doing so throughout your lives but you must see can find other sources of inspiration whether that is in artistic works real world events like mandela's story or in the example set by your fellow students graduates and family members models for inspiration can be found everywhere identifying what inspires you will hold you in good stead as you strive to make a difference it will in mandela's parlance enable you to exceed your own expectations for saint andrews student that translates to the belief that inspiration will enable you ever to excel i speak on behalf of your tutors your peers and your families when i say that you are people with boundless potential so take today to celebrate your successes you have earned that right but tomorrow look around identify your inspirations and hold these in mind as you move forward

Good afternoon, it is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this virtual degree conferral ceremony for the 2020 winter graduation at the University of Saint Andrews. Some of you will already have recognized that these proceedings are not taking place in the younger hall, which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929. The younger hall is currently undergoing refurbishment. To revitalize this venue for use of future generations. We are instead celebrating these rituals in Parliament Hall on South St Ave, which refers to a much older tradition of graduation. Parliament Hall and the chamber above the King James Library commenced construction in 1612 to provide the university with its first proper library, following increasing donations of books including around 200 volumes from King James the 6th and 1st, and it was completed in 1643. Parliament Hall is so named because it housed the Scottish Parliament of 1645 to 1646, when Parliament retreated to the safety of Saint Andrews, whilst Edinburgh and much of Scotland were gripped by plague. An apt parallel to our present circumstances graduation was hosted in the ceremonial space of Parliament Hall and in the King James Library from at least 1696 until the early 20th century. The tradition of graduation extends back even further and has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century. Of all our traditions, it is our most cherished and significant and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain to this day. The core of the graduation ceremony is the conferral of degrees. Each graduand receives their degree and thus becomes a graduate transitioning from a member of our student community into the next stage of their life. But while this ceremony is a practical one, it is also a ritual of celebration at graduation. We recognize the sustained endeavour our students have undertaken, the commitment they have demonstrated to acquiring knowledge, and the rewards they have gained. The students who graduate today are radically different people from those who joined us as entrance O. We also celebrate the journey they have come on. The skills and friendships they have developed during their time in Saint Andrews. And we offer thanks to the academics, professional staff and family members and friends who have given them the support and encouragement necessary to reach this milestone. I recognize that this virtual conferral ceremony is not in the format that our students envisaged because of ongoing restrictions which limit our capacity to host large gatherings. But you are graduating class are to be commended. Over the past few months, your classes, assessments and research projects have taken place both in person, but also often virtually each of you has adjusted brilliantly and resourcefully to these circumstances and in a time of great isolation. For many you have fostered unity and connection, demonstrating the resilience of the Saint Andrews spirit and the strength of the ties that connect us. However separate we may be. Today's conferral ceremony allows us formally to award your degrees an important step in allowing you to move on to the world of work or further study. But for those of you who wish to participate in a traditional ceremony, we will welcome you and your families to Saint Andrews for an in person graduation event when it is safe for us to gather again, it will be an immensely sweet occasion when we can celebrate together. A physical separation does not detract from the significance of the graduation rights to recognise the Felicity and formality of this ritual we have preserved in this virtual format, many core elements of our graduation tradition. The first of these you have already witnessed as St Salvatore Chapel Choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As principal and Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to preside over these ceremonies and to provide this welcome and in a few minutes the university's chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will add his own words of congratulation. Following the introductions, we will proceed to the conferral of degrees upon students at bachelors, masters and doctoral level. I will call upon the Dean of the respective faculty and ask them to present each graduate for their award. The Dean will read the name of each student, and I will bestow the degree upon them in absentia with Latin phrases, according to our tradition, as one example, to confer the degree of Master of Arts, I would use the words AOS, absenteeism, registros, artsiom, renuncio, which translates to announce that they have received the degree of Master of Arts in absentia. This is the precise moment at which each graduand becomes a graduate. At these ceremonies it is tradition that the university invites guests of honor to address our new graduates, inspires them, and wishes them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives. And I'm very pleased that today's speaker is the university's 54th rector, doctor Laila Hussein OBE. Doctor Hussein assumed this role on the 1st of November after her election by the student body earlier this semester and this is the first time she will address our student body in that capacity. Doctor Hussain is a psychotherapist and a renowned activist for women and girls whose career has focused upon improving conditions for others in society. She is thus an apt model, from which our new graduates can derive inspiration. Doctor Hussain has kindly recorded a graduation message for you each to reflect on and we are honored to have our contribute to our proceedings. After the rector's words, I will deliver the graduation address, following which the ceremony will close with the benediction and musical contributions from the university organist Tom Wilkinson and the Chancellor's Piper Alistair Robinson. Here in Saint Andrews, the teachers and staff who have supported you are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 607 years and who support one another in the present. So while you are graduating, you will not leaving our community, but you are taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. It is our sincere hope that you will return to celebrate your graduation in person with your friends and family, academics and professional staff in due course and that you will continue to engage as a St Andrean throughout your life. I am now pleased to introduce the Chancellor of the University of Saint Andrews, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem. At this time of year I normally have the privilege of meeting many of you. As I performed the traditional and formal act of conferring your degree. By tapping you on the head with a berekum or cap. Sadly, this opportunity is not available at present. Some of you are already graduates of the university. But for those who are not, your graduation signifies your acceptance into the academic family of the university. To all of you ioffer my warmest congratulations. This is a special place. With unmatched reputation and tradition. We hope that we've made an impression on you. For you have certainly made an impression on us. Remember, as graduates, your ambassadors of Scotland's oldest university and custodians of its reputation, you will always be welcome here. And you go with our blessing, our admiration and our affection. Thank you to the chancellor for those generous words of wisdom and congratulation.

It brings me great pleasure now to introduce the 54th rector of the University of Saint Andrews, Dr Laila Hussein Obiee to speak to our new graduates. Hello everyone, I'm Laila Hussein, the newly elected rector and I have the privilege of being the first congratulate you on your graduation. So let me start by saying many many congratulations and I wish we could all be together to celebrate in person. But the fact that we cannot be together does not remove how special this occasion is and I hope you are all celebrating with family friends in a safe and enjoyable way. I know that the cohort which has graduated includes undergraduates receiving their first degree master students who have completed further studies. And doctoral students who have just attained the highest possible level of academic qualifications well done to you all whatever stage of study you have completed, you now have a Banksy new degree titles, which can confidently add to your e-mail signature. Twitter bio. You know sometime soon, hopefully in your business cards and you should not be shy in doing this. You won't extremely hard and deserve such credit. This is my first time formally addressing the student's body, since assuming the role as director on November 1st. And I would like to say how honored I am to have been welcomed into your Community. It is clear to me that Saint Andrews this special plays full of special students, and I feel incredibly grateful that I'll be able to work alongside you for the next few years. This may sound a bit outdated given that most of you are about to take your next steps outside of Saint Andrews, however. Something that became clear to me when the election results was announced in that finishing studies at Saint Andrews is by no means or prevalent to the end of your journey with the university. In the weeks following the election I received messages of support from people around the world from Brazil to Cameroon, United Arab Emirates, Italy, Portugal, here in Scotland in the UK. Just to name a few. So whilst San Andrews is relatively small university and town compared to my hometown in London, it is clearly a cosmopolitan global and modern university. We are all lucky to belong in this community. Community means different things to different people. I feel like I'm part of a community when I'm surrounded by people who support me, who encourage me to achieve my goals. I'm thankful to be surrounded by friends, colleagues, students who make me feel this way very often. But being part of a community is not just by receiving, but it's also giving it's reciprocal. You can take support when you need it, but you must also return it and ultimately you must work with a greater good in mind. I'm sure I'm sure you all have your own communities in mind. Whether this is your with your family or friends or sport or society or people you share values and principles with. Community has never been more important this year. Which has been full of challenges so many of us are. I know we'll all have felt this way during your academic work, which will have been harder during the pandemic. Some of you may have experienced financial difficulties, losses, or part time jobs too. And I admit that mental health for all of us has been affected. All of us and has made a rapid changes. Rapid changes around this is happening as we speak. Some of us have coped better than others. Our communities support us in these times even when we cannot meet in person by enabling us to rise to these challenges and overcome them to seek help when needed to give help when it's required by others. And as a result, to ensure that we will overcome our difficulties together. I know you already support each other so well in at Saint Andrews. One of the things I want to focus on as a rector is a Co creation community driven solution to the obstacles we are collectively facing. It's very important we do that together. That is, after all, the only way to make meaningful changes when we all participate. So. Once you're leaving the community of active students in Saint Andrews, you're transitioning into another. The community of the former staff students around you around the world who keep in touch with one another and with the university at most times. That community would always would be there to support you and you are very fortunate indeed to belong to such group. As you enter your new work places, universities, clubs etc. As you as as you join your new communities are hope you take with you what you have learned in Saint Andrews, your commitment to shared progress support. And excellence. And in turn. To be best member of those communities that you can be. Again, congratulations to all of you. Thank you very much to doctor Laila Hussein for that memorable contribution. I will now add some remarks of my own to conclude today's ceremony, and here I speak directly to our new graduates, for whom my first message is one of emphatic congratulations. The degree you have received was not easily earned. It acknowledges months or years of hard work, focus and discipline, but you have triumphed and you are now a Saint Andrews graduate. Nobody can take that accomplishment away from you. I recognize that your cohort in particular has overcome unique challenges. Since March, the COVID-19 pandemic has, as we all know, radically affected the way each of us lives and works. You are the first generation of students in my lifetime who have been unable to browse the University of Saint Andrews Library shelves, or even when the pandemic first struck access, study space or laboratories. Research requires concentration over a long period and you have sustained this while adapting to radically shifting circumstances and varying access to resources. You have special cause to be proud of the way you have overcome these difficulties. Research by its very nature makes you adaptable. It requires you to think round issues, to consider a variety of sources or inputs and to innovate in order to attain results. It requires mental agility. Your graduating class has needed to demonstrate a much higher capacity for adaptation than many which have gone before it, and you are as a result, extraordinarily capable people. You can perform highly whilst traversing uncharted terrain. You are dynamic and fortitude anous you have the capability to confront challenges and to overcome them. Those are indispensable skills because your lives will be filled with challenges. You will face tasks and projects in the workplace to which you will need to step U. You will face upheavals in your personal life. Although I hope these are few in number. You will find that you can draw on the resilience the invention, the hope, and the new companionship which you have built and exhibited in the past few months. You have got through these times and they will become an important part of you as the place in which you experience them will too. Your experiences and skills mean that as graduates you have the ability to address these challenges when they arise and to identify the wider societal issues which stand to benefit from interventions by people with your education and expertise. The challenges you choose to confront are up to you, as are the ways you confront them. You can run for public office or like Doctor Hussain found a charity. Alternatively, you can integrate small acts of kindness or advocacy into your daily life. I know that this is a significant request. It takes audacity to enact change, and it is certainly much easier to do nothing. But helping others is a nobler way to use your education and leads to a more fulfilling life. Meeting these lofty standards requires courage and inspiration models for which can be found at every turn. A source of continual inspiration to me is Nelson Mandela, known to you all as the first black president of the Republic of South Africa, a road he assumed after 27 years of incarceration as a consequence of his retaliation against an oppressive apartheid regime. Mandela's legacy is recorded in his writing, most notably the Long Walk to Freedom, which I wholeheartedly recommend to you all, and in the many dramatizations of his life. Foremost amongst these is the 2009 film Invictus directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela. It dramatizes Mandela's first term in office and charts his efforts to foster interracial alliances and partnerships in a country marked by the legacies of apartheid. Mandela exercised an almost unimaginable capacity to forgive the white citizens of South Africa who persecuted him. If I cannot change when circumstances demand it, how can I expect others to? Mandela says in Invictus? These are words to live by. The title of the film Invictus is derived from a poem of the same name written in 1875 by the Victorian poet William Ernest Henley, who received an honorary doctorate from the University of Saint Andrews in 1893. It is a short poem, 4 stanzas and 16 lines in total, and many of you will be familiar with its closing stanza. It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishments the screw. I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul. Henry's poem expresses the Uncontrollability of resilience and determination and a conviction that one can and must overcome the challenges one faces despite their scale, one can see why Mandela found it to be such a source of potent inspiration. He memorized its lines and during his time at Robben Island Prison, recited the poem to himself and his fellow prisoners. The poem has since assumed an enormous cultural legacy, particularly in the civil rights movement. It served also as inspiration to the late Congressman John Lewis, and it was read by Barack Obama at the memorial service for Mandela in South Africa upon his death in December 2013. The film Invictus depicts Mandela's efforts to build an interracial alliance with Francois Pienaar, captain of the Springboks South Africa's national rugby union team. We find another link here because Francois Pienaar visited St. Andrews at the end of 2017 alongside fellow rugby player Sean Fitzpatrick and footballer Lilian Thuram. A triad of world champions who were advocating for the power of sport to improve life for people around the world. In Invictus, Mandela gives the poem to Francois and he says we need inspiration Francois because in order to build our nation we must all exceed our own expectations. Your time in Saint Andrews has served as a source of inspiration and it will go on doing so throughout your lives. But you must see can find other sources of inspiration, whether that is in artistic works, real world events like Mandela's story or in the example set by your fellow students, graduates and family members. Models for inspiration can be found everywhere. Identifying what inspires you will hold you in good stead as you strive to make a difference. It will, in Mandela's parlance, enable you to exceed your own expectations. For Saint Andrews student, that translates to the belief that inspiration will enable you ever to excel. I speak on behalf of your tutors, your peers and your families. When I say that you are people with boundless potential. So take today to celebrate your successes you have earned that right, but tomorrow, look around, identify your inspirations and hold these in mind as you move forward with the knowledge that you have the ability to affect great change. You are the master of your fate. Do with it what you should. Oremus Grazia Domini Nostri Yasuke Christi, at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum, omnibus nobis in secular secular Orum Ahmed."
