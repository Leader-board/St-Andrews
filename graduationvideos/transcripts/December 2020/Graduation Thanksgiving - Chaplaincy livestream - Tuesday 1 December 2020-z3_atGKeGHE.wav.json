protector all the days of their lives we asked this in jesus name ohmen the reading is from philippians chapter four verse four rejoice in the lord always again i will say rejoice let your gentleness be known to everyone the lord is near do not worry about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known to god and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus finally beloved whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is pleasing whatever

the god of peace will be with you i rejoice in the lord great greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me indeed you are not concerned for me but had no opportunity to show it not that i am referring to being in need for i have learned to be content with whatever i have i know what are these to have little and they know what it is to have plenty and in any and all circumstances i have learned the secret of being well fed and of going hungry of having plenty and of being in need i can do all things through him who strengthens me here ends the reading thanks be to god gracious as it was in the name of god father son and holy spirit are men the school my mother went to in glasgow was called laurel bank it's mortal withdrawn from today's bible lesson at least in the authorized version of the bible and here it is whatsoever things are honest just pure lovely and of good report think on these things it's quite a lot to fit on a blazer and my mother simply remembers the motto as think on these things do you know it's not a bad motto for a graduation today day today or tomorrow or indeed earlier this year although if i'm honest it all feels very strange there are ghosts in saint andrews today graduates clutching their gown and hood supporters in their finery ghosts of the choir singing the gaudeamus as the academics process into the younger hall ghosts of bagpipe music leading us all under the tower ghostly mini fudge donuts leaden on tables at the reception spectral ball gores looking for all the world like revelers at a party in the great gatsby there are ghosts around us today because of course it cannot happen in the flesh and yet the essence of graduation remains true after a period of study after a period of thinking on things in arts and divinity or in medicines and science and then delivering our own work in integrity teachers have reckoned that you are worthy of your degree your report is good and a degree is conferred today's ceremony may be virtual but the achievement is real couples come to this chapel since avatar chapel to be married and i often say to them that your wedding lasts for a day while your marriage lasts for life well on a graduation day isn't it the same we graduate in a day but our degree is for life well what is the purpose of that lifelong degree could i suggest that this year perhaps more than any other year a degree is for truth whatsoever things are honest can also be translated as we heard one of our graduates this year read earlier can also be translated whatever is true throughout your degree whether an undergraduate degree or a masters or a doctorate you have learned to sift error from accuracy prejudice from probability falsehood from truth you've been encouraged to read and listen and watch skeptically and to write and speak and present honestly your degree has led you to recognize what is true and honourable and just and pure and pleasing and commendable or indeed even to recognise how hard these things are to recognise in this degree which is for life perhaps then graduation is like a marriage vow i graduate of of the university of saint andrews give myself to you beautiful complicated mixed up fragile world i promise you my honesty integrity and faithfulness for as long as we both shall live of course honesty matters in every degree from arabic to zoology but this morning i'd like to focus briefly on our graduates in medicine of all the faculties perhaps medicine is the most prominent this year in a time of the global pandemic medical students have learned some knowledge and some skills which they will need to treat covid nineteen among other conditions affecting human beings but fundamentally our medical students have also begun to explore a central idea in the health service the duty of candor let me explain over a decade ago it was discovered in a particular british hospital that there were significant problems affecting patient care including a lack of openness among the authorities it led to a public inquiry which made a number of recommendations including the adoption of a duty of candor that's a statutory duty to be open and honest with patients and members of their family when something goes wrong which appears to have caused significant harm or could cause such harm in the future it includes saying sorry offering support and remedy if that is possible and it applies not only to patients but with colleagues it seems to me that this could be a concept worthy of wider distribution than NHS dot UK how about a duty of candor when something goes wrong in government or in international relations or in business or sport or in charities or institutions of higher education perhaps we needn't have it as a statutory duty but simply as a way of life if every saint andrews graduate acted with honesty and spoke with candor and lived in integrity even in a world unfaithful to these things i'd like to be around these graduates for the rest of my life they you or make a real difference in climate change in the character of companies you work for and in your commitment to the vulnerable throughout your life finally this year appeared to offer little to be grateful for indeed for some this has been a year of immense sadness but the apostle paul encouraged us to rejoice in the lord always for god is true and faithful to the world and so on this day in this season of thanksgiving let us give thanks for god 's truth and faithfulness to all the world let us continue to think beyond our degree on whatever is true and let us find candor is no longer a duty for us but a delight thanks be to god for this preaching of his holy word and his name with the praise and the glory in the prayers which now follow there is a response when i say god of love i invite and invite others to join in with here our prayer god of love hear our prayer let us pray eternal god we pray for all who graduate today tomorrow or who have graduated earlier this year that they would live lives of truth and commitment we pay for all who have made the graduations happen during this extraordinary year for our principal and her team for academics other staff wardens janitors cleaners all in IT who make online conferrals and services possible indeed we pray for all who contribute to the university that they would know your blessing in their working lives god of love hear our prayer we pray for all who suffer injury sickness and loss all who have suffered with covid all awaiting test results on all who walk alongside them that you would be their companion in strength and patience giving them hope when they feel they have lost all hope and in a quiet moment we think of those on our hearts at this time god of love here our prayer we

      "display": "All are welcome at the service of Thanksgiving in since Salvatore's Chapel in the University of Saint Andrews, on the first of two days of conferrals of degrees. Please be seated. This follows 4 days in July. Earlier this year, on which degrees were conferred. These online events have replaced the usual graduation ceremonies in the younger hall this year, and instead of a Chapel service every day of graduation, this service today offers Thanksgiving for all who have graduated in 2020. My name is Donald McEwen and I'm the university chaplain, and you're welcome whether you share the faith of this Chapel or do not, and whether you are here in person or taking part via the live stream. I'm sorry to say that Sam Ferguson, the assistant chaplain, is unable to be with us in person today. We meet for worship to give thanks to God for all his gifts and guidance in our time in this university and in all of life. The printed order gives guidance as to the way that we will worship when words are in bold type. I invite you to join in with them together. As congregational singing is not allowed, hymns will be sung by choral scholars and at the end of the service, could I ask you to stay in your place until the end of the organ music, after which our ushers will guide you out? I wait for the Lord with longing. I put my hope. In his word. We worship God in hearing the wonderful hymn of praise, praise my soul, the King of heaven. Eyes. Almighty and eternal God. And the shadow of the Solemnity of Saint Andrew, the spiritual patron of our country, of this town, and this university. We give thanks to you for all your graces and benefits bestowed upon the students of Saint Andrews who are graduating this week. In spite of all the extraordinary challenges laid before them this year, you have brought them to this day by your Providence and by your Grace. This day we give you thanks for your wondrous gifts which we have neither gained nor merited by our own efforts, but have received from your love and mercy alone. The gifts of creation and of our own existence. Give us the grace to be humble and accept these gifts with gratitude and joy. For in so doing, we acknowledge your sovereignty and glory. This day we give you thanks for the time and the talents that the graduates of Saint Andrews have dedicated to their studies and therefore by their own merits have rightfully earned their degrees. We are grateful for the knowledge gained, the friendships made. The joy and enthusiasm of those we have met. And the love and sacrifices of parents and family members who have made this journey possible. This day we give you thanks for the University of Saint Andrews itself. For its founders, its benefactors. It's continued promotion of the pursuit of knowledge and of truth. Above all we give you thanks for the tireless dedication, inspiration and encouragement of its members of staff. May their sacrifices be rewarded in the education, development, and success of the very people whom they have taught or supported and who graduate this week. Merciful God. As we give thanks for all your graces. We are also conscious of the times when we have failed you and our neighbour through lack of charity. We believe that through your son, Jesus Christ, you came in mercy to forgive. Forgive us our failures and may we in turn be given the grace to show mercy and compassion to those who have failed us, or in any way let us down. Father as our graduates move on in life from this place. They do so with joy and Thanksgiving in their hearts. For all that they have received and personally achieved. May they cherish the memories of their time here at Saint Andrews. And always be willing to share the privileges they have received from their education. And may St. Andrew be their guide and protector all the days of their lives. We asked this in Jesus name. Ohmen the reading is from Philippians chapter 4 verse 4. Rejoice in the Lord always again I will say rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, beloved, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable. If there is any excellence, and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. Keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me. And the God of peace will be with you. I rejoice in the Lord great greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me. Indeed, you are not concerned for me, but had no opportunity to show it. Not that I am referring to being in need for. I have learned to be content with whatever I have. I know what are these to have little and they know what it is to have plenty and in any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of being well fed and of going hungry of having plenty and of being in need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me. Here ends the reading. Thanks be to God. Gracious. As it was. In the name of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit are men. The school my mother went to in Glasgow was called Laurel Bank. It's mortal withdrawn from today's Bible lesson, at least in the authorized version of the Bible. And here it is. Whatsoever things are honest. Just pure lovely and of good report. Think on these things. It's quite a lot to fit on a blazer. And my mother simply remembers the motto as think on these things. Do you know it's not a bad motto for a graduation today day today or tomorrow or indeed earlier this year? Although if I'm honest. It all feels very strange. There are ghosts in Saint Andrews today. Graduates clutching their gown and hood supporters in their finery. Ghosts of the choir singing the Gaudeamus. As the academics process into the younger hall ghosts of bagpipe music leading us all under the tower. Ghostly Mini fudge Donuts. Leaden on tables at the reception. Spectral ball gores looking for all the world like revelers at a party in The Great Gatsby. There are ghosts around us today because of course. It cannot happen in the flesh. And yet the essence of graduation remains true after a period of study. After a period of thinking on things in arts and divinity or in medicines and science. And then delivering our own work in integrity. Teachers have reckoned. That you are worthy of your degree. Your report is good. And a degree is conferred. Today's ceremony may be virtual, but the achievement is real. Couples come to this Chapel since Avatar Chapel to be married, and I often say to them. That your wedding lasts for a day. While your marriage lasts for life well on a graduation day, isn't it the same? We graduate in a day. But our degree is for life. Well, what is the purpose of that lifelong degree? Could I suggest that this year, perhaps more than any other year? A degree is for truth. Whatsoever things are honest. Can also be translated as we heard one of our graduates this year. Read earlier can also be translated. Whatever is true. Throughout your degree, whether an undergraduate degree or a Masters or a doctorate, you have learned to sift error from accuracy, prejudice from probability. Falsehood from truth. You've been encouraged to read and listen and watch skeptically. And to write and speak and present honestly. Your degree has led you to recognize what is true and honourable and just and pure and pleasing and commendable, or indeed even to recognise how hard these things are to recognise. In this degree, which is for life. Perhaps then graduation is like a marriage vow. I graduate of of the University of Saint Andrews. Give myself to you. Beautiful, complicated, mixed up fragile world. I promise you my honesty. Integrity. And faithfulness. For as long as we both shall live. Of course, honesty matters in every degree from Arabic to zoology, but this morning I'd like to focus briefly on our graduates in medicine. Of all the faculties, perhaps medicine is the most prominent this year. In a time of the global pandemic. Medical students have learned some knowledge and some skills which they will need to treat COVID-19, among other conditions affecting human beings. But fundamentally, our medical students have also begun to explore a central idea. In the health service. The duty of candor. Let me explain. Over a decade ago, it was discovered in a particular British hospital that there were significant problems affecting patient care, including a lack of openness among the authorities. It led to a public inquiry which made a number of recommendations, including the adoption of a duty of candor. That's a statutory duty to be open and honest with patients and members of their family. When something goes wrong, which appears to have caused significant harm or could cause such harm in the future. It includes saying sorry. Offering support. And remedy if that is possible. And it applies not only to patients. But with colleagues. It seems to me that this could be a concept worthy of wider distribution than nhs.uk. How about a duty of candor when something goes wrong in government or in international relations, or in business or sport or in charities? Or institutions of higher education? Perhaps we needn't have it as a statutory duty, but simply as a way of life. If every Saint Andrews graduate acted with honesty and spoke with Candor, and lived in integrity, even in a world unfaithful to these things. I'd like to be around these graduates. For the rest of my life. They. You or make a real difference. In climate change. In the character of companies you work for. And in your commitment to the vulnerable throughout your life. Finally, this year appeared to offer little to be grateful for. Indeed, for some, this has been a year of immense sadness. But the apostle Paul encouraged us to rejoice in the Lord always. For God is true and faithful to the world. And so. On this day in this season of Thanksgiving let us give thanks for God's truth and faithfulness to all the world. Let us continue to think beyond our degree on whatever is true. And let us find candor. Is no longer a duty for us. But a delight. Thanks be to God for this preaching of his holy word and his name with the praise. And the glory. In the prayers which now follow, there is a response. When I say God of love, I invite. And invite others to join in with here. Our prayer, God of love. Hear our prayer let us pray. Eternal God, we pray for all who graduate today, tomorrow, or who have graduated earlier this year. That they would live lives of truth and commitment. We pay for all who have made the graduations happen during this extraordinary year for our principal and her team. For academics, other staff, wardens, janitors, cleaners, all in IT who make online conferrals and services possible. Indeed, we pray for all who contribute to the university that they would know your blessing in their working lives. God of love. Hear our prayer. We pray for all who suffer injury, sickness and loss, all who have suffered with COVID all awaiting test results on all who walk alongside them that you would be their companion in strength and patience. Giving them hope when they feel they have lost all hope. And in a quiet moment, we think of those on our hearts at this time. God of love. Here our prayer. We pray for all who hold authority and influence in Hollywood, Westminster and beyond, that they would be open to your wisdom in their decision making. God of love. Hear our prayer. And eternal God, we give thanks for all who have died and now rest in peace. And we pray for all who mourn the loss of their loved ones, that they would know your comfort throughout Advent, Christmas and the New Year. God of love. Here our prayer and we joined together. Now in the prayer Christ himself taught us the our father. The Lord's Prayer, saying our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day Our Daily Bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the Kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. Our concluding him, which we will now hear is Lord of Creation, to you be all praise. She is. Farts?
