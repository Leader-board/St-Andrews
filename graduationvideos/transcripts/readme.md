## Graduation video transcripts

This section contains the transcripts of the graduation videos, which were generated automatically using Azure Cognitive Services. 

### Using the JSON files

There are two parts to the JSON files:

* the combined transcript: gives three representations of the entire transcript. Look for the "display" tag - that's the most "processed" version and (for instance) has correct capitalisation.
* the word-for-word transcript: gives five representations of each sentence (partial or full) it detected, and an estimate on how confident it thinks that transcription is. This can be used for more detailed transcription analysis. 

### Notes

* These transcriptions were generated automatically, and no effort was made to correct any errors in them. 
* In practice, most of the stuff outside the conferral/confirmation of the degrees themselves are reasonably accurate. Regarding the conferral/confirmation part, while it could get some names perfectly, it appeared to struggle with the more complex ones (and hence should be noted if someone is trying to check whether someone appeared in the ceremony). The Latin parts were poorly transcribed in particular. 
* Please do not abuse this or use this for anything this section was not intended for.
