dominum nostrum amen please be seated good morning everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees new professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition which speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i'm really delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year period in which they were necessarily hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome you today and address you directly and i'm sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends colleagues and loved ones in the usual way it certainly means a great deal also to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations our venue today as you all know is the university of saint andrews sports centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall has been closed since july two thousand and nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building is fully accessible to all its users our current utilization of the sports centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the scottish government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic within these legal guidelines all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when moving about the venue that includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees an exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks i have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have removed my face covering for the duration you are entitled of course to remove your coverings upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors but we must ask that you replace them for the graduation reception this afternoon at which you must wear a covering when inside the marquee unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for formal photos are welcome to remove your coverings when the photographer asks you to say cheese what these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenge of our time and i find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder of how far we have come and of the respect and consideration that we at saint andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic the sports centre is a fitting reminder of that too sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic but our sports centre and its over fifty clubs are once again operating at full capacity this parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at saint andrews both our students association and it's over one hundred and thirty societies and the brand new laidlaw music centre are offering their full range both opportunities indeed these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the denial of the pandemic years marking we hope our transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we have an elevated appreciation the university of saint andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the national student survey a UK wide collect collation of student feedback saint andrews has placed first for student satisfaction for each of the past six years including the one in which we were the only university in the country to attain over ninety percent satisfaction this success was paralleled by the times and sunday times good university died for twenty twenty two in which saint andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed ahead of both oxford and cambridge those two attainments the pandemic notwithstanding are a powerful testament to what we do here the quality of our teaching but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students our graduates will thus receive their degrees from scotland and the UK 's premier university as well as scotland 's oldest saint andrews is the third oldest university in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest anywhere the tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony the first of these you have already witnessed as since our theaters chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudi armours and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelor 's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates four degrees from their respective faculties and i then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say that superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or ferratum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since december sixteen ninety six i should perhaps add as a tangent that it is regularly dry cleaned when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates to graduates and their assumption of the place within a long lineage of saint andrews alumni when the conferrals are complete since salvatore's chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to the induction of new professors after which we will confer an honorary degree upon today's guest of honour professor caroline series whom we recognise today to close our tradition our ceremony it is tradition that the university invites a guest to address our new graduates to inspire them and wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives today's guest speaker is bishop board law professor stephen weiker from the school of psychology and neuroscience the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession here in saint andrews the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and eight years and who support one another in the present so while you are graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint country

invoice ohio so she's more body ohg so we will now turn to the induction of new professors an integral and important part of our graduation tradition academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries most notably between european and american models at saint andrews the first academic posting is conventionally electric ship and lecturers become senior lecturers then readers as they progress up the ladder although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement the pursuit of excellence and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field it is a significant pinnacle in an academic career alongside the induction of new professors today we will also mark the appointment of a bishop ward law professor the title of bishop ward law professor is bestowed by the university court upon academics who have been elected as a fellow of one of the united kingdoms two leading learned societies the british academy for scholars in the arts and humanities and the royal society for science and medicine scholars membership of ivory of these bodies is extremely prestigious and an honour attained only by the leading academics of our time the title takes its name from the founder of our university bishop henry wardlaw to recognise that those who carry it participate in a tradition of scholarly excellence established over six hundred years ago prior to this graduation session there have been just twenty one bishop ward law professors at the university since the position was introduced in nineteen ninety seven we thus recognise and formally induct our new professors and bishop ward law professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can celebrate i will call forth the new professors and they will be inducted into the professoriate with prescribed latin phrases each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction the academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students including some of those who have just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines promoting the transmission of ideas generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence let us recognize their successes now on the instruction of the sonatas academicas of which i declare this a duly constituted meeting i shall now install its newly appointed professors quando quidam in universitate sancti andrei valqui sunt high profesiones there were a number of vacant appointments in several

statistics vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science on oris kaiser professor caroline series professor ceres was an undergraduate at somerville college oxford and then won a kennedy scholarship to study at harvard for her PHD in mathematics she held posts at the university of california in berkeley and at newnham college cambridge before taking up a lectureship at the university of warwick where she has remained in nineteen ninety two she became one of the very first women to hold the post to professor of mathematics in the united kingdom in standard euclidean geometry the angles of any triangle add up to a hundred and eighty degrees but there exist other types of geometry where this is not the case in hyperbolic geometry we imagine ourselves at the top of a mountain pass to both sides of us the ground rises steeply whilst in front and behind of us it drops away if we were to draw a triangle on the ground just here we would see that the angles add up to less than a hundred and eighty degrees and it is at these heady heights that professor series work begins the shortest paths around these mountain passes need not go in straight lines and her early work developed a way of describing these paths encoding them via sequences of symmetries this encoding is of fundamental importance having applications to number theory as well as to geometry and dynamics and led to an invitation to speak at the international congress of mathematicians in nineteen eighty six after this professor series focus shifted to understanding hyperbolic geometries by studying their symmetries which are much richer than those of standard geometry this work yields beautiful pictures of fractals and her famous book indras pearls written with david mumford and david wright both describes the mathematics and contains some gorgeous images it's aimed at those with no specialist mathematical knowledge and i highly recommend it to you all in addition to her mathematical research and her publications talks and media appearances popularising mathematics professor series has worked tirelessly to improve gender equality she was a co-founder of the organisation european women in mathematics and went on to be a chair of the european and vice chair of the international women in mathematics committees she was awarded the senior anne bennett prize of the london mathematical society in recognition of both her outstanding research and her commitment to women in mathematics professor series has won more awards than crisis than i could possibly list here so let me single out only a few firstly she's a fellow of the royal society and of the american mathematical society this year she was awarded the david crighton medal by the institute of mathematics and its applications and the london mathematical society in recognition of her fundamental and beautiful results connecting geometry and dynamical systems and her outstanding service to the mathematical community finally i must also mention her recent service as president of the london mathematical society only the third woman to hold this post professor series contributions to scholarly research to public communication of science to the mathematical community and to the support of women in mathematics make her a shining example to us all vice chancellor in recognition of her major contributions to mathematics i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science on aurous cowser on professor caroline series tay edgardo doctoris cianci honoris causa promove you curious ray in symbolum superette poke berekum imponent vice chancellor graduands ladies and gentlemen it's a very great honour to be presented with this degree from this most ancient university as you've just heard i got my first degree from england 's oldest university oxford i got my PHD from the oldest university in the united states harvard i was not able for various reasons to be at the degree ceremony for either of those degrees so i couldn't be more proud to be presented with a degree this degree from the most the oldest university in scotland it means a great deal to me so thank you very much but this occasion is really about all of you who are graduating it's a pivotal moment in your lives after so many years of hard work education study you're finally about to embark on the next stage in your life 's journey i congratulate you all and wish you every success in finding your future as we've recently been so starkly reminded in glasgow this is also a pivotal moment for the planet we have been told that we have ten years to save the planet and i don't believe this is a joke so it is probably no exaggeration to say that your generation is graduating at one of the most important moments in human history your generation will be playing an absolutely central role and we need you as never before i hope and trust that many of you will be able to use the knowledge and skills you have acquired here in saint andrews alongside your new fresh energy ideas and creativity in a huge effort which will be needed to put us all back on a better track never underestimate yourself never think you can't do something because you're too young or inexperienced good luck and courage to all of you thank you i call upon bishop wardlaw professor stephen reicher of the school of psychology and neuroscience i needed that after an hour inside of mask vice chancellor 's graduate staff and guests whenever i think of the last eighteen months of covid i'm led irresistibly to the open lines of dickens tale of two cities which i'm sure you know well it was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity it was the season of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair you see scientists do occasionally read novels the worst of times well the winter of despair that's the easy part since the pandemic began we've experienced things unprecedented in all our lifetimes confined to our houses shops closed stadier empty forbidden to travel banned from mixing even with our loved ones locked up and locked down as if we were convicts even though we've done nothing wrong and we suffered for it we suffered emotionally we suffered socially we suffered physically and in particular we suffered psychologically fear uncertainty isolation all of these took their toll what's more the toll has been particularly high for young people in general and for students in particular on read thoreau once complained that students should not just study life and advised how could you better learn to live then by at least once trying the experiment of living he was right but what he missed is that universities are not only about the study of life they are also experiments in living they are about discovering new activities forming new relationships debating new ideas developing new passions that doesn't detract from learning as leonardo da vinci recognised it is essential to learning the study without desire spoils the memory and it retains nothing that it takes in and experiments in living have been greatly stunted this last academic year the inability to come together and to play or think and drink a bite or two or possibly even three has been a huge loss and a huge burden it's a loss that you will never be able to recoup we recognise that we too grieve for that we know that the ultimate university has not been as good as it should be but i'm beginning to sound like a divorced lawyer at a wedding and today is meant to be a celebration and not awake my task is not to drag you down with doom and gloom but to send you out with hope and expectation so it's time to deliver on what might seem as a more difficult challenge to understand covid as not just the worst but also as the best of times well it might seem a difficult challenge but actually it's very easy because the evidence i think is all around us it's there at a global level the activist rebecca rebecca solnit has written a remarkable collection well she's introduced a remarkable collection of tales of solidarity around the world from northern syria to north america where people often let down by their governments came together to support and to care for one another she writes of the beauty of ordinary peoples generosity creativity solidarity and bravery and she also describes the joy that people felt even in the worst of circumstances in finding the agency to act and the communion of acting together and finding a connection that can be hard to find and feel and have recognised by others in ordinary times the evidence it's also clear it's a national level i think it is estimated i've been involved in a project looking at this and it's estimated that some twelve million people in the UK were involved in activities to support each other during the pandemic creating a sense of community delivering food taking people to hospital walking their dog all those small acts of kindness which the state can never provide but which have enormous impact on our lives and i'm sure many of you were involved in these activities neighbourhood whatsapp group and looking after each other through the pandemic and i was equally if not more amazed by the solidarity and kindness among students this is especially important to stress this i think because there's been a narrative especially last autumn and to some extent this that students were the problem causing spikes in infection due to their wanton socialising and partying well yes there certainly was a party or two but if students have high infection rates it was more due to living together in crowded halls and flats using public transport as well as many of you working in bars and restaurants and other public facing jobs if anything the remarkable thing was how many students who were the personal level had great incentive but face little risk from going out nevertheless chose to stay in for the sake of their communities the media like to trumpet the exceptions and the bad news and they ignore the mundane good news of so many people doing the hurriyet heroic act of staying on the sofa and watching the television much has been spoken about the inequalities in this pandemic inequalities of gender inequalities of class inequalities of ethnicity and race but perhaps the greatest inequality is generational even if young people are less likely to die the toll on mental health on education on economic wellbeing and on future opportunities has been enormous young people have made enormous sacrifices for the older generation that's a lot but this all together too much when on top of that you are blamed rather than celebrated for your response so here and now let us give credit where enormous credit is due thank you thank you for your kindness and your solidarity and your understanding thank you for getting vaccinated and revaccinated and tested and endlessly retested thank you as i say for the mundane heroism of staying on your sofa when you could have gone out and partied and thank you above all for demonstrating even in the worst of times the potential for a society where solidarity and community prevail and where we are all the better for it and who knows where in the context of climate change we might even survive as a species if that endures if we manage to hang on to this memory when the pandemic finally subsides then it could be that even if it is somewhat too much to think of covid as the best of times it might at least be seen as heralding better times thank you please rise for the

welcome you today and address you directly and i'm sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends colleagues and loved ones in the usual way it certainly means a great deal also to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations our venue today as you all know is the university of saint andrews sports centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929 the younger hall has been closed since july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building is fully accessible to all its users our current utilization of the sports centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the scottish government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic within these legal guidelines all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when moving about the venue that includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees an exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks i have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have removed my face covering for the duration you are entitled of course to remove your coverings upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors but we must ask that you replace them for the graduation reception this afternoon at which you must wear a covering when inside the marquee unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for formal photos are welcome to remove your coverings when the photographer asks you to say cheese what these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenge of our time and i find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder of how far we have come and of the respect and consideration that we at saint andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic the sports centre is a fitting reminder of that too sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic but our sports centre and its over 50 clubs are once again operating at full capacity this parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at saint andrews both our students association and it's over 130 societies and the brand new laidlaw music centre are offering their full range both opportunities indeed these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the denial of the pandemic years marking we hope our transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we have an elevated appreciation the university of saint andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the national student survey a UK wide collect collation of student feedback saint andrews has placed first for student satisfaction for each of the past six years including the one in which we were the only university in the country to attain over 90% satisfaction this success was paralleled by the times and sunday times good university died for 2022 in which saint andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed ahead of both oxford and cambridge those two attainments the pandemic notwithstanding are a powerful testament to what we do here the quality of our teaching but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students our graduates will thus receive their degrees from scotland and the UK's premier university as well as scotland's oldest saint andrews is the third oldest university in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest anywhere the tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony the first of these you have already witnessed as since our theaters chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudi armours and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelor's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates 4 degrees from their respective faculties and i then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say that superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or ferratum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since december 1696 i should perhaps add as a tangent that it is regularly dry cleaned when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates to graduates and their assumption of the place within a long lineage of saint andrews alumni when the conferrals are complete since salvatore's chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to the induction of new professors after which we will confer an honorary degree upon today's guest of honour professor caroline series whom we recognise today to close our tradition our ceremony it is tradition that the university invites a guest to address our new graduates to inspire them and wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives today's guest speaker is bishop board law professor stephen weiker from the school of psychology and neuroscience the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession here in saint andrews the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 608 years and who support one another in the present so while you are graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st country and throughout your life decanus faculty artis arzum vice chancellor i have the honor to present for the degree of master of arts with

organised ones and academic structures vary between countries most notably between european and american models at saint andrews the first academic posting is conventionally electric ship and lecturers become senior lecturers then readers as they progress up the ladder although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement the pursuit of excellence and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field it is a significant pinnacle in an academic career alongside the induction of new professors today we will also mark the appointment of a bishop ward law professor the title of bishop ward law professor is bestowed by the university court upon academics who have been elected as a fellow of one of the united kingdoms 2 leading learned societies the british academy for scholars in the arts and humanities and the royal society for science and medicine scholars membership of ivory of these bodies is extremely prestigious and an honour attained only by the leading academics of our time the title takes its name from the founder of our university bishop henry wardlaw to recognise that those who carry it participate in a tradition of scholarly excellence established over 600 years ago prior to this graduation session there have been just 21 bishop ward law professors at the university since the position was introduced in 1997 we thus recognise and formally induct our new professors and bishop ward law professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can celebrate i will call forth the new professors and they will be inducted into the professoriate with prescribed latin phrases each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction the academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students including some of those who have just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines promoting the transmission of ideas generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence let us recognize their successes now on the instruction of the sonatas academicas of which i declare this a duly constituted meeting i

science on oris kaiser professor caroline series professor ceres was an undergraduate at somerville college oxford and then won a kennedy scholarship to study at harvard for her PHD in mathematics she held posts at the university of california in berkeley and at newnham college cambridge before taking up a lectureship at the university of warwick where she has remained in 1992 she became one of the very first women to hold the post to professor of mathematics in the united kingdom in standard euclidean geometry the angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees but there exist other types of geometry where this is not the case in hyperbolic geometry we imagine ourselves at the top of a mountain pass to both sides of us the ground rises steeply whilst in front and behind of us it drops away if we were to draw a triangle on the ground just here we would see that the angles add up to less than 180 degrees and it is at these heady heights that professor series work begins the shortest paths around these mountain passes need not go in straight lines and her early work developed a way of describing these paths encoding them via sequences of symmetries this encoding is of fundamental importance having applications to number theory as well as to geometry and dynamics and led to an invitation to speak at the international congress of mathematicians in 1986 after this professor series focus shifted to understanding hyperbolic geometries by studying their symmetries which are much richer than those of standard geometry this work yields beautiful pictures of fractals and her famous book indras pearls written with david mumford and david wright both describes the mathematics and contains some gorgeous images it's aimed at those with no specialist mathematical knowledge and i highly recommend it to you all in addition to her mathematical research and her publications talks and media appearances popularising mathematics professor series has worked tirelessly to improve gender equality she was a co-founder of the organisation european women in mathematics and went on to be a chair of the european and vice chair of the international women in mathematics committees she was awarded the senior anne bennett prize of the london mathematical society in recognition of both her outstanding research and her commitment to women in mathematics professor series has won more awards than crisis than i could possibly list here so let me single out only a few firstly she's a fellow of the royal society and of the american mathematical society this year she was awarded the david crighton medal by the institute of mathematics and its applications and the london mathematical society in recognition of her fundamental and beautiful results connecting geometry and dynamical systems and her outstanding service to the mathematical community finally i must also mention her recent service as president of the london mathematical society only the third woman to hold this post professor series contributions to scholarly research to public communication of science to the mathematical community and to the support of women in mathematics make her a shining example to us all

this most ancient university as you've just heard i got my first degree from england's oldest university oxford i got my PHD from the oldest university in the united states harvard i was not able for various reasons to be at the degree ceremony for either of those degrees so i couldn't be more proud to be presented with a degree this degree from the most the oldest university in scotland it means a great deal to me so thank you very much but this occasion is really about all of you who are graduating it's a pivotal moment in your lives after so many years of hard work education study you're finally about to embark on the next stage in your life's journey i congratulate you all and wish you every success in finding your future as we've recently been so starkly reminded in glasgow this is also a pivotal moment for the planet we have been told that we have 10 years to save the planet and i don't believe this is a joke so it is probably no exaggeration to say that your generation is graduating at one of the most important moments in human history your generation will be playing an absolutely central role and we need you as never before i hope and trust that many of you will be able to use the knowledge and skills you have acquired here in saint andrews alongside your new fresh energy ideas and creativity in a huge effort which will be needed to put us all back on a better track never underestimate yourself never think you can't do something because you're too young or inexperienced good luck and courage to all of you thank you i call upon bishop wardlaw professor stephen reicher of the school of psychology and neuroscience i needed that after an hour inside of mask vice chancellor's graduate staff and guests whenever i think of the last 18 months of covid i'm led irresistibly to the open lines of dickens tale of two cities which i'm sure you know well it was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity it was the season of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair you see scientists do occasionally read novels the worst of times well the winter of despair that's the easy part since the pandemic began we've experienced things unprecedented in all our lifetimes confined to our houses shops closed stadier empty forbidden to travel banned from mixing even with our loved ones locked up and locked down as if we were convicts even though we've done nothing wrong and we suffered for it we suffered emotionally we suffered socially we suffered physically and in particular we suffered psychologically fear uncertainty isolation all of these took their toll what's more the toll has been particularly high for young people in general and for students in particular on read thoreau once complained that students should not just study life and advised how could you better learn to live then by at least once trying the experiment of living he was right but what he missed is that universities are not only about the study of life they are also experiments in living they are about discovering new activities forming new relationships debating new ideas developing new passions that doesn't detract from learning as leonardo da vinci recognised it is essential to learning the study without desire spoils the memory and it retains nothing that it takes in and experiments in living have been greatly stunted this last academic year the inability to come together and to play or think and drink a bite or two or possibly even 3 has been a huge loss and a huge burden it's a loss that you will never be able to recoup we recognise that we too grieve for that we know that the ultimate university has not been as good as it should be but i'm beginning to sound like a divorced lawyer at a wedding and today is meant to be a celebration and not awake my task is not to drag you down with doom and gloom but to send you out with hope and expectation so it's time to deliver on what might seem as a more difficult challenge to understand covid as not just the worst but also as the best of times well it might seem a difficult challenge but actually it's very easy because the evidence i think is all around us it's there at a global level the activist rebecca rebecca solnit has written a remarkable collection well she's introduced a remarkable collection of tales of solidarity around the world from northern syria to north america where people often let down by their governments came together to support and to care for one another she writes of the beauty of ordinary peoples generosity creativity solidarity and bravery and she also describes the joy that people felt even in the worst of circumstances in finding the agency to act and the communion of acting together and finding a connection that can be hard to find and feel and have recognised by others in ordinary times the evidence it's also clear it's a national level i think it is estimated i've been involved in a project looking at this and it's estimated that some 12 million people in the UK were involved in activities to support each other during the pandemic creating a sense of community delivering food taking people to hospital walking their dog all those small acts of kindness which the state can never provide but which have enormous impact on our lives and i'm sure many of you were involved in these activities neighbourhood whatsapp group and looking after each other through the pandemic and i was equally if not more amazed by the solidarity and kindness among students this is especially important to stress this i think because there's been a narrative especially last autumn and to some extent this that students were the problem causing spikes in infection due to their wanton socialising and partying well yes there certainly was a party or two but if students have high infection rates it was more due to living together in crowded halls and flats using public transport as well as many of you working in bars and restaurants and other public facing jobs if anything the remarkable thing was how many students who were the personal level had great incentive but face little risk from going out nevertheless chose to stay in for the sake of their communities the media like to trumpet the exceptions and the bad news and they ignore the mundane good news of so many people doing the hurriyet heroic act of staying on the sofa and watching the television much has been spoken about the inequalities in this pandemic inequalities of gender inequalities of class inequalities of ethnicity and race but perhaps the greatest inequality is generational even if young people are less likely to die the toll on mental health on education on economic wellbeing and on future opportunities has been enormous young people have made enormous sacrifices for the older generation that's a lot but this all together too much when on top of that you are blamed rather than celebrated for your response so here and now let us give credit where enormous credit is due thank you thank you for your kindness and your solidarity and your understanding thank you for getting vaccinated and revaccinated and tested and endlessly retested thank you as i say for the mundane heroism of staying on your sofa when you could have gone out and partied and thank you above all for demonstrating even in the worst of times the potential for a society where solidarity and community prevail and where we are all the better for it and who knows where in the context of climate change we might even survive as a species if that endures if we manage to hang on to this memory when the pandemic finally subsides then it could be that even if it is somewhat too much to think of covid as the best of times it might at least be seen as heralding better times thank you please rise for the

It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees. New professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition which speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I'm really delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year. In which they were necessarily hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus, with a renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome you today and address you directly, and I'm sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, colleagues and loved ones in the usual way. It certainly means a great deal also to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations. Our venue today, as you all know, is the University of Saint Andrews Sports Centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall, which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929. The younger hall has been closed since July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building is fully accessible to all its users. Our current utilization of the Sports Centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the Scottish Government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic. Within these legal guidelines, all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when moving about the venue. That includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees. An exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks. I have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have. Removed my face covering for the duration you are entitled of course to remove your coverings. Upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors. But we must ask that you replace them for the graduation reception this afternoon at which you must wear a covering when inside the marquee. Unless in the act of eating and drinking. There is a professional photography studio set up here in the Sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for formal photos are welcome to remove your coverings. When the photographer asks you to say cheese. What these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenge of our time, and I find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder of how far we have come and of the respect and consideration that we, at Saint Andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic. The Sports Centre is a fitting reminder of that too. Sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic, but our sports Centre and its over 50 clubs are once again operating at full capacity. This parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at Saint Andrews. Both our students association and it's over 130 societies and the brand new Laidlaw Music Centre are offering their full range. Both opportunities. Indeed, these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the denial of the pandemic years marking. We hope our transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary, progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we have an elevated appreciation. The University of Saint Andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the National Student Survey, a UK wide collect collation of student feedback, Saint Andrews has placed first for student satisfaction for each of the past six years, including the one in which we were the only university in the country to attain over 90% satisfaction. This success was paralleled by the Times and Sunday Times good university. Died for 2022, in which Saint Andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed ahead of both Oxford and Cambridge. Those two attainments, the pandemic notwithstanding, are a powerful testament to what we do here. The quality of our teaching, but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students. Our graduates will thus receive their degrees from Scotland and the UK's Premier University, as well as Scotland's oldest. Saint Andrews is the third oldest university in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest anywhere. The tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. The first of these you have already witnessed, as since our theaters Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudi armours and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow this introduction. The conferral of these awards at Bachelor's Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition, I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates 4 degrees from their respective faculties, and I then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though we simply say. That superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or ferratum touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since December 1696. I should perhaps add as a tangent that it is regularly dry cleaned when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews Taylor and it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates. To graduates and their assumption of the place within a long lineage of Saint Andrews alumni. When the Conferrals are complete. Since Salvatore's Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins, for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to the induction of new professors, after which we will confer an honorary degree upon today's guest of honour. Professor Caroline series, whom we recognise today. To close our tradition our ceremony. It is tradition that the university invites a guest to address our new graduates, to inspire them and wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives. Today's guest speaker is Bishop Board law professor Stephen Weiker from the School of Psychology and Neuroscience. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. Here in Saint Andrews, the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 608 years and who support one another in the present. So while you are graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St. Country, and throughout your life. Decanus faculty Artis arzum.

We will now turn to the induction of new professors, an integral and important part of our graduation tradition. Academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries, most notably between European and American models. At Saint Andrews, the first academic posting is conventionally electric ship, and lecturers become senior lecturers, then readers as they progress up the ladder, although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice. Professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly, and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement, the pursuit of excellence, and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field. It is a significant pinnacle in an academic career. Alongside the induction of new professors today, we will also mark the appointment of a Bishop Ward law professor. The title of Bishop Ward Law professor is bestowed by the university court upon academics who have been elected as a fellow of one of the United Kingdoms. 2 leading learned societies, the British Academy for scholars in the Arts and Humanities and the Royal Society for Science and Medicine Scholars. Membership of ivory of these bodies is extremely prestigious and an honour attained only by the leading academics of our time. The title takes its name from the founder of our university, Bishop Henry Wardlaw. To recognise that those who carry it participate in a tradition of scholarly excellence established over 600 years ago. Prior to this graduation session, there have been just 21 Bishop Ward law professors at the university. Since the position was introduced in 1997. We thus recognise and formally induct our new professors and Bishop Ward law professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can celebrate. I will call forth the new professors and they will be inducted into the professoriate with prescribed Latin phrases. Each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime. Committed to the written word, each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice, which is gifted. To them by the university and presented out with this ceremony, the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction. The academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students, including some of those who have just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines, promoting the transmission of ideas, generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence. Let us recognize their successes now. On the instruction of the sonatas academicas, of which I declare this a duly constituted meeting, I shall now install its newly appointed professors. Quando quidam in Universitate Sancti Andrei Valqui sunt high profesiones, there were a number of vacant appointments in several schools at the university. Professor in Schola biologia. Professores in scholar CMCI Informatica. Professor in schoola medicinally. Professor in Schola Cianciarulo Mentis professor Ward lawrences. Visum West Courier. Alstom Universitatis Air Munera his colleague stymies Mandaree. Professor is Nikita Maggie Strickley Austim Universitatis statue errant, Austim colleagues in air munara admire. The university court felt it correct to entrust the duties of these appointments to the following colleagues and the professors. Masters of the university were in agreement. I will now summon those forward who are to be installed. Professor Maria Dorneles School of Biology. Professor Richard Connor, School of Computer Science. Professor Graham Kirby, School of Computer Science. Professor Jonathan Ispen at School of Medicine. Professor Julian Brown, School of Psychology and neuroscience. Professor Sir Ian Boyd, Bishop Board law professor. Fairly ganter diplomata. I now request that these certificates are read out. The university court at a meetings held between the 26th of October 2019 and the 22nd of October 2021, received notification of appointments in the schools of Biology, Computer Science, Medicine and Psychology and Neuroscience. Notification was also received of the appointment of a chair in the name of Bishop Ward, Lord.

I call upon Professor Cole Veroni Dougall of the School of Mathematics and Statistics. Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science on Oris Kaiser Professor Caroline series. Professor Ceres was an undergraduate at Somerville College, Oxford, and then won a Kennedy Scholarship to study at Harvard for her PhD in mathematics. She held posts at the University of California in Berkeley and at Newnham College, Cambridge, before taking up a lectureship at the University of Warwick, where she has remained. In 1992, she became one of the very first women to hold the post to professor of mathematics in the United Kingdom. In standard Euclidean geometry, the angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees, but there exist other types of geometry where this is not the case. In hyperbolic geometry, we imagine ourselves at the top of a mountain pass. To both sides of us the ground rises steeply whilst in front and behind of us it drops away. If we were to draw a triangle on the ground just here, we would see that the angles add up to less than 180 degrees and it is at these heady heights that Professor series work begins. The shortest paths around these mountain passes need not go in straight lines, and her early work developed a way of describing these paths, encoding them via sequences of symmetries. This encoding is of fundamental importance having applications to number theory as well as to geometry and dynamics and led to an invitation to speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1986. After this, professor series focus shifted to understanding hyperbolic geometries by studying their symmetries, which are much richer than those of standard geometry. This work yields beautiful pictures of fractals and her famous book Indras Pearls written with David Mumford and David Wright. Both describes the mathematics and contains some gorgeous images. It's aimed at those with no specialist mathematical knowledge and I highly recommend it to you all. In addition to her mathematical research and her publications, talks and media appearances, popularising mathematics professor series has worked tirelessly to improve gender equality. She was a co-founder of the Organisation, European Women in Mathematics and went on to be a chair of the European and Vice Chair of the International Women in Mathematics committees. She was awarded the senior Anne Bennett Prize of the London Mathematical Society in recognition of both her outstanding research and her commitment to women in mathematics. Professor Series has won more awards than crisis than I could possibly list here, so let me single out only a few. Firstly, she's a fellow of the Royal Society and of the American Mathematical Society. This year she was awarded the David Crighton Medal by the Institute of Mathematics and its applications and the London Mathematical Society, in recognition of her fundamental and beautiful results, connecting geometry and dynamical systems, and her outstanding service to the mathematical community. Finally, I must also mention her recent service as President of the London Mathematical Society. Only the third woman to hold this post. Professor series contributions to scholarly research to public communication of science to the mathematical community and to the support of women in mathematics make her a shining example to us all. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of her major contributions to mathematics. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science on Aurous Cowser on Professor Caroline series. Tay Edgardo Doctoris Cianci honoris causa promove you curious ray. In Symbolum superette poke Berekum imponent. Vice chancellor graduands ladies and gentlemen. It's a very great honour to be presented with this degree from this most ancient university. As you've just heard. I got my first degree from England's oldest university, Oxford. I got my PhD from the oldest university in the United States. Harvard. I was not able for various reasons to be at the degree ceremony for either of those degrees, so I couldn't be more proud. To be presented with a degree, this degree from the most the oldest university in Scotland. It means a great deal to me. So thank you very much. But this occasion is really about all of you who are graduating. It's a pivotal moment in your lives. After so many years of hard work education study. You're finally about to embark on the next stage in your life's journey. I congratulate you all. And wish you every success in finding your future. As we've recently been so starkly reminded in Glasgow. This is also a pivotal moment for the planet. We have been told that we have 10 years to save the planet and I don't believe this is a joke. So it is probably no exaggeration to say that your generation is graduating at one of the most important moments in human history. Your generation will be playing an absolutely central role. And we need you as never before. I hope and trust. That many of you will be able to use the knowledge and skills you have acquired here in Saint Andrews. Alongside your new fresh energy ideas and creativity. In a huge effort which will be needed to put us all back on a better track. Never underestimate yourself. Never think you can't do something because you're too young or inexperienced. Good luck and courage to all of you. Thank you. I call upon Bishop Wardlaw, Professor Stephen Reicher of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience. I needed that after an hour inside of mask. Vice Chancellor's graduate staff and guests. Whenever I think of the last 18 months of COVID, I'm led irresistibly to the open lines of Dickens tale of two cities, which I'm sure you know well. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom. It was the age of foolishness. It was the epoch of belief. It was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season of light. It was the season of darkness. It was the spring of hope. It was the winter of despair. You see, scientists do occasionally read novels. The worst of times, well, the winter of despair. That's the easy part. Since the pandemic began, we've experienced things unprecedented in all our lifetimes. Confined to our houses, shops, closed stadier empty, forbidden to travel, banned from mixing even with our loved ones. Locked up and locked down as if we were convicts. Even though we've done nothing wrong. And we suffered for it. We suffered emotionally. We suffered socially. We suffered physically, and in particular, we suffered psychologically, fear, uncertainty, isolation. All of these took their toll. What's more, the toll has been particularly high for young people in general, and for students in particular on read. Thoreau once complained that students should not just study. Life and advised how could you better learn to live? Then by at least once trying the experiment of living. He was right, but what he missed is that universities are not only about the study of life, they are also experiments in living. They are about discovering new activities, forming new relationships, debating new ideas, developing new passions. That doesn't detract from learning, as Leonardo da Vinci recognised, it is essential to learning the study without desire spoils the memory and it retains nothing that it takes in. And experiments in living have been greatly stunted. This last academic year. The inability to come together and to play or think and drink a bite or two, or possibly even 3. Has been a huge loss and a huge burden. It's a loss that you will never be able to recoup. We recognise that we too grieve for that. We know that the ultimate university has not been as good as it should be. But I'm beginning to sound like a divorced lawyer at a wedding. And today is meant to be a celebration and not awake. My task is not to drag you down with doom and gloom, but to send you out with hope and expectation so it's time to deliver on what might seem as a more difficult challenge to understand COVID as not just the worst. But also as the best of times. Well, it might seem a difficult challenge, but actually it's very easy. Because the evidence, I think, is all around us. It's there at a global level. The activist Rebecca Rebecca Solnit has written a remarkable collection. Well, she's introduced a remarkable collection of tales of solidarity around the world, from northern Syria to North America, where people often let down by their governments, came together to support and to care for one another. She writes of the beauty of ordinary peoples, generosity, creativity, solidarity and bravery. And she also describes. The joy that people felt even in the worst of circumstances in finding the agency to act and the communion of acting together and finding a connection that can be hard to find and feel and have recognised by others in ordinary times. The evidence. It's also clear it's a national level. I think it is estimated I've been involved in a project looking at this, and it's estimated that some 12 million people in the UK were involved in activities to support each other during the pandemic, creating a sense of community delivering food, taking people to hospital, walking their dog, all those small acts of kindness which the state can never provide, but which have enormous impact on our lives. And I'm sure many of you were involved in these activities. Neighbourhood WhatsApp group and looking after each other through the pandemic and I was equally if not more amazed by the solidarity and kindness. Among students. This is especially important to stress this, I think because there's been a narrative, especially last autumn, and to some extent this that students were the problem causing spikes in infection due to their wanton socialising and partying. Well, yes, there certainly was a party or two. But if students have high infection rates, it was more due to living together in crowded halls and flats using public transport as well as many of you working in bars and restaurants and other public facing jobs. If anything, the remarkable thing was how many students who were the personal level had great incentive but face little risk from going out. Nevertheless chose to stay in for the sake of their communities. The media like to. Trumpet the exceptions and the bad news and they ignore the mundane good news of so many people doing the Hurriyet heroic act of staying on the sofa and watching the television. Much. Has been spoken about the inequalities in this pandemic inequalities of gender inequalities of class inequalities of ethnicity and race, but perhaps the greatest inequality is generational even if young people are less likely to die. The toll on mental health on education on economic wellbeing and on future opportunities has been enormous. Young people have made enormous sacrifices for the older generation. That's a lot. But this all together too much when on top of that you are blamed rather than celebrated for your response. So here and now, let us give credit where enormous credit is due. Thank you. Thank you for your kindness and your solidarity and your understanding. Thank you for getting vaccinated and revaccinated and tested and endlessly retested. Thank you as I say, for the mundane heroism of staying on your sofa when you could have gone out and partied. And thank you above all for demonstrating, even in the worst of times, the potential for a society where solidarity and community prevail and where we are all the better for it. And who knows where in the context of climate change we might even survive as a species? If that endures, if we manage to hang on to this memory when the pandemic finally subsides, then it could be that even if it is somewhat too much to think of COVID as the best of times. It might at least be seen as heralding better times. Thank you. Please rise for the benediction. Oremus Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen. Feels."
