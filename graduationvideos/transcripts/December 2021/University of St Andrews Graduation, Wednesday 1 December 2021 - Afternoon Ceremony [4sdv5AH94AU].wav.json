eternam consequi per yessum christum dominum nostrum amen please be seated good afternoon everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees new professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year period in which they were necessarily hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome you today and address you directly and i am sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends with colleagues and with loved ones in the usual way it certainly means a great deal to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations our venue today as you all know is the university of saint andrews sports centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall has been closed since july two thousand and nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building is fully accessible to all users our current utilisation of the sport centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the scottish government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic within those legal guidelines all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when moving about the venue that includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees an exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks i have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have removed my face covering for the duration you are entitled of course to remove your coverings upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors but we must ask that you replace them for the graduation reception this afternoon at which you must wear a covering when inside the marquee unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for formal photos are welcome to remove your coverings when the photographer ask you to say cheese what these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenge of our time and i find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder i have how far we have come and as the respect and consideration that we at saint andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic the sports centre is a fitting reminder of that too sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic but our sports centre and its over fifty clubs are once again operating at full capacity this parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at saint andrews both our students association and its over one hundred and thirty societies and the brand new laidlaw music centre are offering their full range of opportunities indeed let us hope that these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the denormal of the pandemic years marking we hope our transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary will progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we have now an elevated appreciation the university of saint andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the national student survey a UK wide collation of student feedback saint andrews has placed first for student satisfaction for each of the past six years including this one in which we were also the only university in the country to attain over ninety percent satisfaction the success was paralleled by the times and sunday times good university guide for twenty twenty two in which saint andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed first ahead of both oxford and cambridge those two attainments the pandemic notwithstanding are a powerful testament to what we do here the quality of our teaching but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students our graduates will thus receive their degrees from scotland and the UK 's premier university as well as scotland 's oldest saint andrews is the third oldest university in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest anywhere the tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow after this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berate them touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and i just paused to hit pause here to assure you that it is very regularly dry cleaned and it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates into graduates and there are sumption of the place within a long lineage of saint andrews alumni when the conferrals are complete since our theatre chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to the induction of new professors after which we will confer an honorary degree upon today's guest of honour andrew marr whom we recognise today i will deliver the graduation address to close our ceremony a traditional message of congratulation and inspiration to our new graduates the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession here in saint andrews the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and eight years and who support one another in the present so while you are graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artists arzum vice chancellor i have the

important part of our graduation tradition academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries most notably between european and american models at saint andrews the first academic posting is conventionally a lectureship and lecturers become senior lecturers then readers as they progress up the ladder although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement the pursuit of excellence and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field it is a significant clinical in an academic career we thus recognise and formally induct our new professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can celebrate i will call forth the new professors and they will be inducted into the professoriate with prescribed latin phrases each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction the academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students including some of those who've just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines promoting the transmission of ideas generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence let us recognise their successes now on the instruction of the sonatas academicas of which i declare this a duly constituted meeting i shall now install its newly appointed professors

of the school of international relations vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of letters honoris causa andrew marr andrew marr was brought up in long forgin near dundee not far away from here and educated at various scottish schools including the high school of dundee he graduated with the first class orders degree in english from trinity hall university of cambridge in nineteen seventy seven following graduation he pursued a career in journalism writing and editing for the scotsman the independent the economist the daily express the observer and the BBC in two thousand and five after five years working in the very prominent role as political editor the BBC 's andrew marr continued his work in television and radio and still as many of you will be aware regularly presents for the time being at least the andrew marshall and start the week throughout andrews career he's gone beyond the news headlines including making and presenting historical documentaries and writing several books including the battle for scotland the history of modern britain among others that depth of knowledge has helped to eliminate the big topics of the day now at a time when there's so much at stake informed debate and discussion is more important than ever before his work on history is an important part of that work and as andrew himself stated history is either a moral argument with lessons for the here and now or it is merely an accumulation of pointless facts andrew marr made a significant impact on public dialogue across the united kingdom and beyond for over forty years he spent his time explaining why politics matters providing accessible insights into the decisions we make as citizens and those that are made on our behalf in his long and distinguished career he's been the recipient of over a dozen awards for his writing and broadcasting including columnist of the year in the british press awards channel four 's journalist awards and best specialist factual programme at the british academy television awards andrew is often quoted as saying that journalism is often simply the industrialization of gossip well i'd like to argue here that it's far more important than that and far more than that andrew informed respectful debate lies at the heart of a democratic society enhancing the ability to develop ideas and innovation that makes life better for all of us all too often it's something that we take for granted all of us politics and policy making matters to each and every one of us and scrutiny is an important and integral part of our society now i'm well aware that politics is a passionate affair and rightly so as right to be passionate about politics but dispassionate informed reporting so that our citizens are better informed to undertake their duties as citizens is also important now sometimes interrogation by andrew mark can make for an uncomfortable experience for politicians but that's as it should be if democracy and debate are to thrive it's also about providing a voice for those who do not have one and earlier this year the royal television society announced their television journalism awards that andrew myers interview with the chinese ambassador in the countries treatment of the weaker community with their interview of the year for its meticulous research described by the judges as and i quote TV interviewing art at its best now recently andrew announced that after twenty one years of the BBC he'll be moving to to global radio and other outlets as well as we understand and and as so as a social media profile explained he is keen to get his voice back and i think he's already starting that process at the moment but i'm sure like like me you will follow his next career moves with enormous interest but with characteristic professionalism andrew marr reminded us in the first andrew marr show after his announcement that this work is and i quote always about the stories and not about the storyteller that being said this morning we did get a sneaky preview in the university chapel service where andrew flagged the climate emergency and how that matters across generations more than any other issue of our day-to-day and what i found was an incredibly powerful ceremon and a sneak peek indeed for what we've got to look forward to in the time to come andrew 's champion of critical thought is a valuable service and it makes him a worthy recipient of his numerous rewards however his work has been even more impressive in recent times given the personal challenges that he has faced following a stroke in two thousand and thirteen he underwent extensive treatment which included being helped to walk again now none of that has prevented andrew marr from continuing his work as a journalist and continuing to be a regular broadcaster indeed characteristically he and his family have used the experience to raise awareness of the causes and symptoms of strokes and i'm sure andrew won't mind me taking the opportunity today to refer to his wife jackie ashley who joins us today who's been a tireless campaigner and fundraiser in recent years on these issues and she's very welcome here today as well more recently in two thousand and eighteen andrew had a malignant tumour removed and was back at work after a short recovery missing just two of his sunday morning shows andrew myers commitment to his profession and holding the powerful to account for their actions is unrivalled more than that his fortitude and inspirational approach to the challenges he has faced through illness in recent years illustrates what it takes to strive and embodies this university 's motto ever to excel regardless of the circumstances vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to journalism television and radio i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters honours kausa on andrew mark thank you we can have more applause in a minute tay edgarton doctoris litteram honoris causa from movie you curious three in symbolum superette hope berekum imponent well professor gethins i wish you'd know this you've seen what they said about me on twitter every day now i am aware that some of you may be keen to go and celebrate very soon and quite rightly so so i won't be taking up much of your time but i do want to say how genuinely humbled and privileged i am to join as it were the wider family of this best of universities i trust that saint andrews will continue over the years to be a place yes of friendliness and tolerance and kindness but above all of excellence really really hard work day after day week after week and i have to say standing here receiving all these compliments for what has been let's be honest forty one years of blether blether blether after so many outstanding graduates and all the hard work they've done does make me feel just a little bit silly but that said i want to leave you with one thought it is really important for this university to thrive over the years and decades ahead by being a place of excellence and that includes uncomfortable heterodox unusual brave thought and that requires in turn frank responsible yes but above all free speech let this be a place a bastion of free speech in a world which in many ways is flinching and turning away from it thank you very much as principal it now falls to me to deliver today's graduation address and let me begin with wholehearted congratulations to you our new graduates you have done it the degrees you have just collected whether earned over one year or across several more represent countless hours of concentrated thought and work and whilst studying is always a challenging and sometimes a solitary pursuit that chess your grit and determination to excel you have been challenged more than most the pandemic has meant that all of you have at times had limited access to in person resources like libraries and classrooms even to saint andrews itself and some of you have studied at all hours via laptops balanced atop kitchen counters and stacks of books to ensure that you have made it through the last twenty one months with something of such value to show for it today is a day and you can stand atop the mountain of that success and rightly feel very proud of what you have achieved i hope that all of you will be proud to call yourself a saint andrews graduate for the rest of your life but all of you will venture forth to new challenges whether that is further study the world of work or any number of other pursuits being an engaged and driven person means making the effort to learn and develop throughout one 's life and that means constantly striving towards the next opportunity it's the sentiment embodied by the university 's motto as the two excel which is an instructive principle to guide you through the journey ahead wherever you adventure next you will always have the photographs from today to remind you of this moment and of the way you feel currently already in this ceremony several hundred photographs i'm sure will have been taken some will already have been texted tweeted instagrammed and so forth this is indeed probably happening in this hall with more or less surreptitious ness as i speak when in a few minutes we'll process outside it will be to a blizzard of photos posed and informal of selfies class photos photos potentially with large pieces of inflatable equipment later on in the quad by the castle or cathedral in the north sea if you're feeling brave with the principle if you're feeling even braver and lovely photos with families and friends now it was not of course always so many of us from the generations mostly above yours have few photographs from our graduation ceremonies apart from the awkwardly balanced one with the screw and the mortarboard in front of a bland university background against which we were lined up for all of thirty seconds before it was someone else 's turn you should all be very thankful that saint andrews traditional dress dispensers with mortar words which do terrible things to one 's hair by contrast you will have many photos to encapsulate this glorious day hairdos intact but there will nonetheless be one or two that you come back to inexorably because they capture the essence of what this day means to you every picture tells the story but some will always tell it more meaningfully than others the university of saint andrews has strong associations with the early history of photography in great britain in part through the engagement and encouragement of one of my predecessors as principal sir david brewster sir david was a physicist specialising in optics who amongst other things invented the kaleidoscope and he was a friend and collaborator of william henry fox talbot who invented the calotype a photography processing technique in eighteen thirty nine sir david worked to foster an interest in such emerging photographic techniques through his vice presidency of the saint andrews literary and philosophical society a group through which he inspired the emergence of leading photographic practitioners including robert adamson sir david later served as the first president of the photographic society of scotland founded in eighteen fifty six and his position within the heart of scotland 's flourishing photographic culture has made our university a global leader on this subject our photograph our photographic collection dates to eighteen forty four and contains over one million items of historical significance all of which are archived in our special collections and are accessible for research purposes students come to saint andrews from around the world to benefit from this either as researchers or as master students on our prestigious history of photography emlit program and our school of art history accommodates leading experts on photographic history and culture such as doctor natalie adamson and doctor luke gartlan photography in sir david 's time was necessarily a specialised activity as determined by the resource required to engage in the early practice but the advance of technology has led to a proliferation of photographic activity such that many of us can snap photos so much more readily nonetheless i do still encourage all of you to choose your subjects carefully if taking a photograph is a way of recording your engagement with the world then i urge you to pursue the most exciting subjects in when you can the most far flung places mirror selfies are good for dating profiles at a pinch but you are privileged to have the ability to photograph anything you desire choose boldly and dream larger than your bathroom choosing what to photograph can be a political act too in susan sontag 's seminal book on photography published in nineteen seventy seven as the ability to take photos was becoming more ubiquitous she envisages the photographer as someone who is engaged in the act of imprisoning reality and she goes so far as to claim that the unwitting subject is violated by the photographer 's lens i'm sure your friends will be very happy to jump into photographs in a moment 's time susan 's views aside but susan does valuably remind us that what and whom we photograph is important and that the resulting images attain a symbolic value which can be sentimental but also political and that photographs can accumulate meaning over time in ways that the photographer never intended as saint andrews graduates you see the world through highly educated eyes and can approach social issues structures and events with greater nuance and complexity as a result it is up to you to view record and shape the world as you see fit and i encourage all of you to use the abilities you have developed here to shine light on issues that need your attention to champion causes of note and to bring about a vision of the world that improves perpetually on the society you are inheriting that is the way to be an exemplary saint andrews graduate i for one have always loved photos both taking and viewing them and my office in college gate is filled with images of members of our university community on special occasions much like today these photos remind me of the quality of our students the remarkable work being carried out by our researchers and the way that our institution has improved the world for over six hundred years so i very much hope that the photos you take today will remind you of your place within that lineage and other friends and loved ones who have made it possible and who will support you throughout your life so in addition to remembering to say cheese when you yourself are photographed remember to thank your loved ones today and remember whenever you look at the photos in years to come that saint andrews will always wherever you may be be your home and a part of your story thank you please stand for the benediction oremus grazia dominos three sacristy at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum ohmen",

yessum christum dominum nostrum amen please be seated good afternoon everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees new professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year period in which they were necessarily hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome you today and address you directly and i am sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends with colleagues and with loved ones in the usual way it certainly means a great deal to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations our venue today as you all know is the university of saint andrews sports centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929 the younger hall has been closed since july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building is fully accessible to all users our current utilisation of the sport centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the scottish government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic within those legal guidelines all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when moving about the venue that includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees an exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks i have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have removed my face covering for the duration you are entitled of course to remove your coverings upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors but we must ask that you replace them for the graduation reception this afternoon at which you must wear a covering when inside the marquee unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for formal photos are welcome to remove your coverings when the photographer ask you to say cheese what these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenge of our time and i find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder i have how far we have come and as the respect and consideration that we at saint andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic the sports centre is a fitting reminder of that too sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic but our sports centre and its over 50 clubs are once again operating at full capacity this parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at saint andrews both our students association and its over 130 societies and the brand new laidlaw music centre are offering their full range of opportunities indeed let us hope that these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the denormal of the pandemic years marking we hope our transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary will progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we have now an elevated appreciation the university of saint andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the national student survey a UK wide collation of student feedback saint andrews has placed first for student satisfaction for each of the past six years including this one in which we were also the only university in the country to attain over 90% satisfaction the success was paralleled by the times and sunday times good university guide for 2022 in which saint andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed first ahead of both oxford and cambridge those two attainments the pandemic notwithstanding are a powerful testament to what we do here the quality of our teaching but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students our graduates will thus receive their degrees from scotland and the UK's premier university as well as scotland's oldest saint andrews is the third oldest university in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest anywhere the tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow after this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berate them touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and i just paused to hit pause here to assure you that it is very regularly dry cleaned and it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates into graduates and there are sumption of the place within a long lineage of saint andrews alumni when the conferrals are complete since our theatre chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to the induction of new professors after which we will confer an honorary degree upon today's guest of honour andrew marr whom we recognise today i will deliver the graduation address to close our ceremony a traditional message of congratulation and inspiration to our new graduates the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession here in saint andrews the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 608 years and who support one another in the present so while you are graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artists arzum vice

graduation tradition academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries most notably between european and american models at saint andrews the first academic posting is conventionally a lectureship and lecturers become senior lecturers then readers as they progress up the ladder although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement the pursuit of excellence and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field it is a significant clinical in an academic career we thus recognise and formally induct our new professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can celebrate i will call forth the new professors and they will be inducted into the professoriate with prescribed latin phrases each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction the academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students including some of those who've just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines promoting the transmission of ideas generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence let us recognise their successes now on the instruction of the sonatas academicas of which i declare this a duly constituted meeting i shall now install its newly appointed professors quando quidam in universitatis thank

honoris causa andrew marr andrew marr was brought up in long forgin near dundee not far away from here and educated at various scottish schools including the high school of dundee he graduated with the first class orders degree in english from trinity hall university of cambridge in 1977 following graduation he pursued a career in journalism writing and editing for the scotsman the independent the economist the daily express the observer and the BBC in 2005 after five years working in the very prominent role as political editor the BBC's andrew marr continued his work in television and radio and still as many of you will be aware regularly presents for the time being at least the andrew marshall and start the week throughout andrews career he's gone beyond the news headlines including making and presenting historical documentaries and writing several books including the battle for scotland the history of modern britain among others that depth of knowledge has helped to eliminate the big topics of the day now at a time when there's so much at stake informed debate and discussion is more important than ever before his work on history is an important part of that work and as andrew himself stated history is either a moral argument with lessons for the here and now or it is merely an accumulation of pointless facts andrew marr made a significant impact on public dialogue across the united kingdom and beyond for over 40 years he spent his time explaining why politics matters providing accessible insights into the decisions we make as citizens and those that are made on our behalf in his long and distinguished career he's been the recipient of over a dozen awards for his writing and broadcasting including columnist of the year in the british press awards channel 4's journalist awards and best specialist factual programme at the british academy television awards andrew is often quoted as saying that journalism is often simply the industrialization of gossip well i'd like to argue here that it's far more important than that and far more than that andrew informed respectful debate lies at the heart of a democratic society enhancing the ability to develop ideas and innovation that makes life better for all of us all too often it's something that we take for granted all of us politics and policy making matters to each and every one of us and scrutiny is an important and integral part of our society now i'm well aware that politics is a passionate affair and rightly so as right to be passionate about politics but dispassionate informed reporting so that our citizens are better informed to undertake their duties as citizens is also important now sometimes interrogation by andrew mark can make for an uncomfortable experience for politicians but that's as it should be if democracy and debate are to thrive it's also about providing a voice for those who do not have one and earlier this year the royal television society announced their television journalism awards that andrew myers interview with the chinese ambassador in the countries treatment of the weaker community with their interview of the year for its meticulous research described by the judges as and i quote TV interviewing art at its best now recently andrew announced that after 21 years of the BBC he'll be moving to to global radio and other outlets as well as we understand and and as so as a social media profile explained he is keen to get his voice back and i think he's already starting that process at the moment but i'm sure like like me you will follow his next career moves with enormous interest but with characteristic professionalism andrew marr reminded us in the first andrew marr show after his announcement that this work is and i quote always about the stories and not about the storyteller that being said this morning we did get a sneaky preview in the university chapel service where andrew flagged the climate emergency and how that matters across generations more than any other issue of our day-to-day and what i found was an incredibly powerful ceremon and a sneak peek indeed for what we've got to look forward to in the time to come andrew's champion of critical thought is a valuable service and it makes him a worthy recipient of his numerous rewards however his work has been even more impressive in recent times given the personal challenges that he has faced following a stroke in 2013 he underwent extensive treatment which included being helped to walk again now none of that has prevented andrew marr from continuing his work as a journalist and continuing to be a regular broadcaster indeed characteristically he and his family have used the experience to raise awareness of the causes and symptoms of strokes and i'm sure andrew won't mind me taking the opportunity today to refer to his wife jackie ashley who joins us today who's been a tireless campaigner and fundraiser in recent years on these issues and she's very welcome here today as well more recently in 2018 andrew had a malignant tumour removed and was back at work after a short recovery missing just two of his sunday morning shows andrew myers commitment to his profession and holding the powerful to account for their actions is unrivalled more than that his fortitude and inspirational approach to the challenges he has faced through illness in recent years illustrates what it takes to strive and embodies this university's motto ever to excel regardless of the circumstances vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to journalism television and radio i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters honours kausa on andrew mark thank you we can have more applause in a minute tay edgarton doctoris litteram honoris causa from movie you curious three in symbolum superette hope berekum imponent well professor gethins i wish you'd know this you've seen what they said about me on twitter every day now i am aware that some of you may be keen to go and celebrate very soon and quite rightly so so i won't be taking up much of your time but i do want to say how genuinely humbled and privileged i am to join as it were the wider family of this best of universities i trust that saint andrews will continue over the years to be a place yes of friendliness and tolerance and kindness but above all of excellence really really hard work day after day week after week and i have to say standing here receiving all these compliments for what has been let's be honest 41 years of blether blether blether after so many outstanding graduates and all the hard work they've done does make me feel just a little bit silly but that said i want to leave you with one thought it is really important for this university to thrive over the years and decades ahead by being a place of excellence and that includes uncomfortable heterodox unusual brave thought and that requires in turn frank responsible yes but above all free speech let this be a place a bastion of free speech in a world which in many ways is flinching and turning away from it thank you very much as principal it now falls to me to deliver today's graduation address and let me begin with wholehearted congratulations to you our new graduates you have done it the degrees you have just collected whether earned over one year or across several more represent countless hours of concentrated thought and work and whilst studying is always a challenging and sometimes a solitary pursuit that chess your grit and determination to excel you have been challenged more than most the pandemic has meant that all of you have at times had limited access to in person resources like libraries and classrooms even to saint andrews itself and some of you have studied at all hours via laptops balanced atop kitchen counters and stacks of books to ensure that you have made it through the last 21 months with something of such value to show for it today is a day and you can stand atop the mountain of that success and rightly feel very proud of what you have achieved i hope that all of you will be proud to call yourself a saint andrews graduate for the rest of your life but all of you will venture forth to new challenges whether that is further study the world of work or any number of other pursuits being an engaged and driven person means making the effort to learn and develop throughout one's life and that means constantly striving towards the next opportunity it's the sentiment embodied by the university's motto as the two excel which is an instructive principle to guide you through the journey ahead wherever you adventure next you will always have the photographs from today to remind you of this moment and of the way you feel currently already in this ceremony several 100 photographs i'm sure will have been taken some will already have been texted tweeted instagrammed and so forth this is indeed probably happening in this hall with more or less surreptitious ness as i speak when in a few minutes we'll process outside it will be to a blizzard of photos posed and informal of selfies class photos photos potentially with large pieces of inflatable equipment later on in the quad by the castle or cathedral in the north sea if you're feeling brave with the principle if you're feeling even braver and lovely photos with families and friends now it was not of course always so many of us from the generations mostly above yours have few photographs from our graduation ceremonies apart from the awkwardly balanced one with the screw and the mortarboard in front of a bland university background against which we were lined up for all of 30 seconds before it was someone else's turn you should all be very thankful that saint andrews traditional dress dispensers with mortar words which do terrible things to one's hair by contrast you will have many photos to encapsulate this glorious day hairdos intact but there will nonetheless be one or two that you come back to inexorably because they capture the essence of what this day means to you every picture tells the story but some will always tell it more meaningfully than others the university of saint andrews has strong associations with the early history of photography in great britain in part through the engagement and encouragement of one of my predecessors as principal sir david brewster sir david was a physicist specialising in optics who amongst other things invented the kaleidoscope and he was a friend and collaborator of william henry fox talbot who invented the calotype a photography processing technique in 1839 sir david worked to foster an interest in such emerging photographic techniques through his vice presidency of the saint andrews literary and philosophical society a group through which he inspired the emergence of leading photographic practitioners including robert adamson sir david later served as the first president of the photographic society of scotland founded in 1856 and his position within the heart of scotland's flourishing photographic culture has made our university a global leader on this subject our photograph our photographic collection dates to 1844 and contains over 1,000,000 items of historical significance all of which are archived in our special collections and are accessible for research purposes students come to saint andrews from around the world to benefit from this either as researchers or as master students on our prestigious history of photography emlit program and our school of art history accommodates leading experts on photographic history and culture such as doctor natalie adamson and doctor luke gartlan photography in sir david's time was necessarily a specialised activity as determined by the resource required to engage in the early practice but the advance of technology has led to a proliferation of photographic activity such that many of us can snap photos so much more readily nonetheless i do still encourage all of you to choose your subjects carefully if taking a photograph is a way of recording your engagement with the world then i urge you to pursue the most exciting subjects in when you can the most far flung places mirror selfies are good for dating profiles at a pinch but you are privileged to have the ability to photograph anything you desire choose boldly and dream larger than your bathroom choosing what to photograph can be a political act too in susan sontag's seminal book on photography published in 1977 as the ability to take photos was becoming more ubiquitous she envisages the photographer as someone who is engaged in the act of imprisoning reality and she goes so far as to claim that the unwitting subject is violated by the photographer's lens i'm sure your friends will be very happy to jump into photographs in a moment's time susan's views aside but susan does valuably remind us that what and whom we photograph is important and that the resulting images attain a symbolic value which can be sentimental but also political and that photographs can accumulate meaning over time in ways that the photographer never intended as saint andrews graduates you see the world through highly educated eyes and can approach social issues structures and events with greater nuance and complexity as a result it is up to you to view record and shape the world as you see fit and i encourage all of you to use the abilities you have developed here to shine light on issues that need your attention to champion causes of note and to bring about a vision of the world that improves perpetually on the society you are inheriting that is the way to be an exemplary st andrews graduate i for one have always loved photos both taking and viewing them and my office in college gate is filled with images of members of our university community on special occasions much like today these photos remind me of the quality of our students the remarkable work being carried out by our researchers and the way that our institution has improved the world for over 600 years so i very much hope that the photos you take today will remind you of your place within that lineage and other friends and loved ones who have made it possible and who will support you throughout your life so in addition to remembering to say cheese when you yourself are photographed remember to thank your loved ones today and remember whenever you look at the photos in years to come that saint andrews will always wherever you may be be your home and a part of your story thank you please stand for the benediction oremus grazia dominos 3 sacristy at caritas day at communicatio

It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees. New professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year. In which they were necessarily hosted online. Due to the pandemic, it is thus with a renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome you today and address you directly, and I am sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends. With colleagues and with loved ones in the usual way, it certainly means a great deal to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations. Our venue today, as you all know, is the University of Saint Andrews Sports Centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall, which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929. The younger hall has been closed since July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building is fully accessible to all users. Our current utilisation of the sport centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the Scottish Government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic. Within those legal guidelines, all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when moving about the venue. That includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees. An exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks. I have to speak throughout the ceremony. And so have removed my face covering for the duration. You are entitled, of course, to remove your coverings. Upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors. But we must ask that you replace them for the graduation reception this afternoon, at which you must wear a covering when inside the marquee, unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for formal photos are welcome to remove your coverings when the photographer. Ask you to say cheese. What these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenge of our time, and I find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder. I have how far we have come and as the respect and consideration that we at Saint Andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic. The Sports Centre is a fitting reminder of that too. Sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic, but our sports Centre and its over 50 clubs are once again operating at full capacity. This parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at Saint Andrews. Both our students association and its over 130 societies and the brand new Laidlaw Music Centre are offering their full range of opportunities. Indeed, let us hope that these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the denormal of the pandemic years marking. We hope our transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary will progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we have now an elevated appreciation. The University of Saint Andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the National Student Survey, a UK wide collation of student feedback, Saint Andrews has placed first for student satisfaction for each of the past six years, including this one in which we were also the only university in the country to attain over 90% satisfaction. The success was paralleled by the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide for 2022, in which Saint Andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed first ahead of both Oxford and Cambridge. Those two attainments, the pandemic notwithstanding, are a powerful testament to what we do here. The quality of our teaching, but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students. Our graduates will thus receive their degrees from Scotland and the UK's Premier University, as well as Scotland's oldest. Saint Andrews is the third oldest university in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest anywhere. The tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. The first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow after this introduction. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and I then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though we simply say at superette meaning, and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berate them. Touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and I just paused to hit pause here to assure you that it is very regularly dry cleaned. And it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates into graduates. And there are Sumption of the place within a long lineage of Saint Andrews alumni. When the Conferrals are complete, since our theatre Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins, for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to the induction of new professors, after which we will confer an honorary degree upon today's guest of honour. Andrew Marr, whom we recognise today. I will deliver the graduation address to close our ceremony. A traditional message of congratulation and inspiration to our new graduates. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. Here in Saint Andrews, the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 608 years and who support one another in the present. So while you are graduating, you are not leaving our community. But taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life. Decanus faculty artists Arzum.

We will now turn to the induction of new professors, an integral and important part of our graduation tradition. Academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries, most notably between European and American models. At Saint Andrews, the first academic posting is conventionally a lectureship, and lecturers become senior lecturers, then readers as they progress up the ladder, although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice. Professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly, and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement, the pursuit of excellence, and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field. It is a significant clinical in an academic career. We thus recognise and formally induct our new professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can celebrate. I will call forth the new professors and they will be inducted into the professoriate with prescribed Latin phrases. Each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word. Each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice, which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony. The books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction. The academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students, including some of those who've just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines, promoting the transmission of ideas, generating discourse, and changing our world as a consequence. Let us recognise their successes now. On the instruction of the sonatas academicas, of which I declare this a duly constituted meeting, I shall now install its newly appointed professors. Quando quidam in Universitatis thank Tiandra AI vacui sunt high profissionais. There were a number of vacant appointments in several schools at the university. Professor in scholar historian.

This states you have been allotted Sparta. Do it credit. I call upon Professor Stephen Gethins of the School of International Relations. Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa Andrew Marr. Andrew Marr was brought up in Long Forgin near Dundee, not far away from here and educated at various Scottish schools, including the high school of Dundee. He graduated with the first class orders degree in English from Trinity Hall University of Cambridge in 1977. Following graduation, he pursued a career in journalism, writing and editing for The Scotsman, the Independent, The Economist, The Daily Express, the Observer and the BBC. In 2005, after five years working in the very prominent role as political editor, the BBC's Andrew Marr continued his work in television and radio and still as many of you will be aware regularly presents for the time being. At least, the Andrew Marshall and start the week. Throughout Andrews career, he's gone beyond the news headlines, including making and presenting historical documentaries and writing several books, including the Battle for Scotland, the history of modern Britain, among others. That depth of knowledge has helped to eliminate the big topics of the day. Now at a time when there's so much at stake, informed debate and discussion is more important than ever before. His work on history is an important part of that work, and as Andrew himself stated, history is either a moral argument with lessons for the here and now, or it is merely an accumulation of pointless facts. Andrew Marr made a significant impact on public dialogue across the United Kingdom and beyond for over 40 years. He spent his time explaining why politics matters, providing accessible insights into the decisions we make as citizens and those that are made on our behalf. In his long and distinguished career, he's been the recipient of over a dozen awards for his writing and broadcasting, including columnist of the Year in the British Press Awards. Channel 4's journalist awards, and best specialist factual programme at the British Academy Television Awards. Andrew is often quoted as saying that journalism is often simply the industrialization of gossip. Well, I'd like to argue here that it's far more important than that, and far more than that. Andrew informed respectful debate, lies at the heart of a democratic society, enhancing the ability to develop ideas and innovation that makes life better for all of us. All too often it's something that we take for granted, all of us. Politics and policy making matters to each and every one of us, and scrutiny is an important and integral part of our society now. I'm well aware that politics is a passionate affair, and rightly so. As right to be passionate about politics but dispassionate, informed reporting so that our citizens are better informed to undertake their duties as citizens is also important. Now sometimes interrogation by Andrew Mark can make for an uncomfortable experience for politicians. But that's as it should be. If democracy and debate are to thrive. It's also about providing a voice for those who do not have one and earlier this year the Royal Television Society announced their television journalism awards that Andrew Myers interview with the Chinese ambassador in the countries treatment of the weaker community with their interview of the year for its meticulous research described by the judges as and I quote TV interviewing art at its best. Now recently Andrew announced that after 21 years of the BBC, he'll be moving to. To Global Radio and other outlets as well as we understand and and as so as a social media profile explained, he is keen to get his voice back and I think he's already starting that process at the moment. But I'm sure like like me, you will follow his next career moves with enormous interest. But with characteristic professionalism, Andrew Marr reminded us in the first Andrew Marr Show after his announcement that this work is, and I quote always about the stories and not about the storyteller. That being said, this morning we did get a sneaky preview in the University Chapel service where Andrew flagged the climate emergency and how that matters across generations more than any other issue of our day-to-day and what I found. Was an incredibly powerful ceremon and a sneak peek indeed for what we've got to look forward to in the time to come. Andrew's champion of critical thought is a valuable service, and it makes him a worthy recipient of his numerous rewards. However, his work has been even more impressive in recent times. Given the personal challenges that he has faced. Following a stroke in 2013, he underwent extensive treatment, which included being helped to walk again. Now, none of that has prevented Andrew Marr from continuing his work as a journalist and continuing to be a regular broadcaster. Indeed, characteristically, he and his family have used the experience to raise awareness of the causes and symptoms of strokes, and I'm sure Andrew won't mind me taking the opportunity today to refer to his wife, Jackie Ashley, who joins us today who's been a tireless campaigner and fundraiser in recent years. On these issues. And she's very welcome. Here today as well. More recently, in 2018, Andrew had a malignant tumour removed and was back at work after a short recovery, missing just two of his Sunday morning shows. Andrew Myers commitment to his profession and holding the powerful to account for their actions is unrivalled. More than that, his fortitude and inspirational approach to the challenges he has faced through illness in recent years illustrates what it takes to strive and embodies this university's motto ever to excel. Regardless of the circumstances. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to journalism, television, and radio, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters. Honours kausa on Andrew Mark. Thank you. We can have more applause in a minute. Tay edgarton Doctoris litteram honoris causa from movie you curious three in symbolum superette hope berekum imponent. Well, professor gethins. I wish you'd know this. You've seen what they said about me on Twitter every day. Now. I am aware that some of you may be keen to go and celebrate very soon, and quite rightly so, so I won't be taking up much of your time. But I do want to say how genuinely humbled and privileged I am to join, as it were, the wider family of this best of universities. I trust that Saint Andrews will continue over the years to be a place. Yes of friendliness and tolerance and kindness. But above all of excellence really really hard work day after day, week after week. And I have to say standing here receiving all these compliments for what has been. Let's be honest, 41 years of blether blether blether after so many outstanding graduates and all the hard work they've done. Does make me feel just a little bit silly, but that said I want to leave you with one. Thought it is really important for this university to thrive over the years and decades ahead by being a place of excellence and that includes uncomfortable, heterodox, unusual, brave thought. And that requires in turn, Frank responsible, yes, but above all, free speech. Let this be a place, a bastion of free speech. In a world which in many ways is flinching and turning away from it, thank you very much. As principal, it now falls to me to deliver today's graduation address. And let me begin with wholehearted. Congratulations to you our new graduates. You have done it. The degrees you have just collected, whether earned over one year or across several more represent countless hours of concentrated thought and work. And whilst studying is always a challenging and sometimes a solitary pursuit that chess, your grit and determination to excel, you have been challenged more. Than most the pandemic has meant that all of you have at times had limited access to in person. Resources like libraries and classrooms, even to Saint Andrews itself. And some of you have studied at all hours via laptops balanced atop kitchen counters and stacks of books to ensure that you have made it through the last 21 months with something of such value to show for it. Today is a day. And you can stand atop the mountain of that success, and rightly feel very proud of what you have achieved. I hope that all of you will be proud to call yourself a Saint Andrews graduate for the rest of your life. But all of you will venture forth to new challenges. Whether that is further study the world of work or any number of other pursuits. Being an engaged and driven person means making the effort to learn and develop throughout one's life. And that means constantly striving towards the next opportunity. It's the sentiment embodied by the university's motto. As the two excel, which is an instructive principle to guide you through the journey ahead. Wherever you adventure next, you will always have the photographs from today to remind you of this moment and of the way you feel currently already. In this ceremony, several 100 photographs I'm sure will have been taken. Some will already have been texted, tweeted, Instagrammed, and so forth. This is indeed probably happening in this hall with more or less surreptitious Ness as I speak. When in a few minutes we'll process outside, it will be to a Blizzard of photos posed and informal of selfies, class photos, photos potentially with large pieces of inflatable equipment. Later on in the quad by the castle or cathedral in the North Sea. If you're feeling brave with the principle, if you're feeling even braver and lovely photos with families and friends. Now it was not, of course always so many of us from the generations mostly above yours have few photographs from our graduation ceremonies, apart from the awkwardly balanced one with the screw and the mortarboard in front of a bland university background against which we were lined up for all of 30 seconds before it was someone else's turn, you should all be very thankful that Saint Andrews traditional dress dispensers with mortar. Words which do terrible things to one's hair. By contrast, you will have many photos to encapsulate this glorious day hairdos intact, but there will nonetheless be one or two that you come back to inexorably because they capture the essence of what this day means to you. Every picture tells the story, but some will always tell it more meaningfully than others. The University of Saint Andrews has strong associations with the early history of photography in Great Britain, in part through the engagement and encouragement of one of my predecessors as Principal Sir David Brewster. Sir David was a physicist specialising in optics who, amongst other things, invented the kaleidoscope and he was a friend and collaborator of William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the calotype, a photography processing technique. In 1839, Sir David worked to foster an interest in such emerging photographic techniques through his vice presidency of the Saint Andrews Literary and Philosophical Society, a group through which he inspired. The emergence of leading photographic practitioners, including Robert Adamson, Sir David, later served as the first President of the Photographic Society of Scotland. Founded in 1856, and his position within the heart of Scotland's flourishing photographic culture has made our university a global leader on this subject. Our photograph. Our photographic collection dates to 1844 and contains over 1,000,000 items of historical significance. All of which are archived in our special collections and are accessible for research purposes. Students come to Saint Andrews from around the world to benefit from this, either as researchers or as master students on our prestigious history of photography emlit program. And our School of Art History accommodates leading experts on photographic history and culture, such as Doctor Natalie Adamson and Doctor Luke Gartlan. Photography in Sir David's time was necessarily a specialised activity as determined by the resource required to engage in the early practice, but the advance of technology has led to a proliferation of photographic activity such that many of us can snap photos so much more readily. Nonetheless, I do still encourage all of you to choose your subjects carefully. If taking a photograph is a way of recording your engagement with the world, then I urge you to pursue the most exciting subjects in when you can. The most far flung places. Mirror selfies are good for dating profiles at a pinch, but you are privileged to have the ability to photograph anything you desire. Choose boldly and dream larger than your bathroom. Choosing what to photograph can be a political act too, in Susan Sontag's seminal book on photography, published in 1977 as the ability to take photos was becoming more ubiquitous. She envisages the photographer as someone who is engaged in the act of imprisoning reality, and she goes so far as to claim that the unwitting subject is violated by the photographer's lens. I'm sure your friends will be very happy to jump into photographs in a moment's time. Susan's views aside, but Susan does Valuably remind us that what and whom we photograph is important, and that the resulting images attain a symbolic value which can be sentimental but also political. And that photographs can accumulate meaning over time in ways that the photographer never intended. As Saint Andrews graduates, you see the world through highly educated eyes and can approach social issues, structures and events with greater nuance and complexity as a result. It is up to you to view, record and shape the world as you see fit, and I encourage all of you to use the abilities you have developed here to shine light on issues that need your attention to champion causes of note and to bring about a vision of the world that improves perpetually on the society you are inheriting. That is the way to be an exemplary St. Andrews graduate. I for one, have always loved photos, both taking and viewing them and my office in college gate is filled with images of members of our university community on special occasions, much like today. These photos remind me of the quality of our students, the remarkable work being carried out by our researchers. And the way that our institution has improved the world for over 600 years. So I very much hope that the photos you take today will remind you of your place within that lineage and other friends and loved ones who have made it possible and who will support you throughout your life. So in addition to remembering to say cheese when you yourself are photographed, remember to thank your loved ones today. And remember, whenever you look at the photos in years to come that Saint Andrews will always, wherever you may be, be your home and a part of your story. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction.
