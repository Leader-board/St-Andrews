glorificus at misericordia two avita maternal consequent periosteum christum dominum nostrum amen please be seated good afternoon it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees new professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year period in which they were necessarily hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome you today and address you directly and i'm sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends colleagues and loved ones in the usual way it certainly means a great deal to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations our venue today as you know is the university of saint andrews sports centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall has been closed since july two thousand and nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building is fully accessible to all its users our current utilization of the sports centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the scottish government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic within those legal guidelines all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when roving moving around the venue that includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees an exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony they are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks i have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have removed my face covering for the duration you are entitled of course to remove your covering upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors but we must ask you to replace them please for the graduation reception this afternoon at which you must wear a covering when inside the marquee unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for formal photos are welcome of course to remove your coverings when the photographer asks you to say cheese what these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenge of our time and i find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder of how far we have come and of the respect and consideration that we at saint andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic the sports centre is a fitting reminder of that too sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic but our sports centre and it's over fifty clubs are once again operating at full capacity this parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at saint andrews both our students association and its over one hundred and thirty societies and the brand new laidlaw music centre are offering their full range of opportunities indeed we are hopeful that these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the danimal of the pandemic years marking our hopeful transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we have now an elevated appreciation the university of saint andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the national student survey a UK wide collection of student feedback saint andrews has placed first for student satisfaction for each of the past six years including this one in which we were also the only university in the country to attain over ninety percent satisfaction this success was paralleled by the times and sunday times good university guide for twenty twenty two in which saint andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed first ahead of both oxford and cambridge those two attainments the pandemic notwithstanding are a powerful testament to what we do here the quality of our teaching but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students our graduates will thus receive their degrees from scotland and the UK 's premier university as well as scotland 's oldest saint andrews is the third oldest university in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest anywhere the tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of our ceremony the first of these you have already witnessed as since salvatore's chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudi armas and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans internal in in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and i should perhaps say in parenthesis that it is regularly dry cleaned and it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption other place within a long lineage of saint andrews alumni when the conferrals are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we're thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to the induction of new professors after which we will confer an honorary degree upon today's guest of honour professor joanna mcgregor whom we recognise today to close our ceremony it is tradition that the university invites a guest to address our new graduates to inspire them and to wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives today's guest speaker is professor monique mckenzie assistant vice principal and provost the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession here in saint andrews the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and eight years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artists artsiom vice chancellor i have the honor to present for the degree of master of

it's a rule love i love we will now turn to the induction of new professors an integral and important part of our graduation tradition academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries most notably between european and american models at saint andrews the first academic posting is conventionally a lectureship and lecturers become senior lecturers then readers as they progress up the ladder although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement the pursuit of excellence and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field it is a significant pinnacle in an academic career we thus recognise and formally induct our new professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can all celebrate i will call forth the new professors and they will be inducted into the prophecy oriat with prescribed latin phrases each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction the academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students including some of those who have just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines promoting the transmission of ideas generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence let us recognise their successes now on the instruction of the sonatas academicas of which

an ancient saying translated into latin by cicero this states you have been a lot of sparta do it credit i call upon doctor michael downes director of music vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of music or norris karza professor joanna mcgregor the last twenty one months have been a period of existential crisis for music demanding resilience and versatility intelligence and imagination as never before from those who practice it it is difficult to think of a musician anywhere in the world who better exemplifies those qualities than joanna macgregor her career not only inspires all who care about music but also illuminates how the art form itself may continue to thrive joanna mcgregor is one of the world 's leading pianists she has performed in over eighty countries across the world working with conductors such as pierre boulez valerie gergiev and simon rattle she is renowned for her expertise and contemporary music encouraging composers as distinguished and diverse as john adams and harrison birtwistle jango bates and james mcmillan to create music for her but she is equally at home in the canonical works of the piano repertoire her recordings include bachs goldberg variations and the art of fugue and the complete shop ann mazurkas and her project in between the two lockdowns last autumn was the astonishing feat of playing all thirty two of beethoven 's piano sonatas across only three days at the canterbury festival for the last twenty years she has also been active as a conductor and has directed concerts with the royal philharmonic the royal liverpool philharmonic the britain symphonia and the halle among other orchestras she has recently taken up a new post as music director of the brighton philharmonic orchestra judging on the basis of her first season which includes collaborations with the northumbrian piper catherine tickel macgregor's own orchestrations of astor piazzolla and live and improvisations to silent films and culminates with her playing brahms first piano concerto under the direction of shawn edwards saint andrews honorary professor of conducting sussex audiences are in for an exciting time as their orchestra approaches its centenary year joanna macgregor's genius for creating stimulating musical juxtapositions has also been displayed in her roles as artistic director of the dartington international summer school and festival and of the bath international music festival as well as an event she has created for organizations including the royal opera house the new york philharmonic and yenching 's contemporary dance theatre of shanghai she is deeply committed to music education she is a professor of the university of london and head of piano at the royal academy of music where she runs an annual summer festival for young musicians and she has written a highly praised series of teaching books for young children entitled piano world for favour music and to add yet another role to those of pianist conductor festival director broadcaster record producer composer and teacher in twenty nineteen joanna mcgregor was one of the judges for the booker prize impressive though this list of joanna macgregor's many roles is what is truly inspiring is the youth she has made of them to inculcate excitement about music in others she has been working across multiple genres and using technology to promote music in new ways long before it was fashionable or necessary to do so collaborations with musicians working in jazz and pop dance and film folk and traditional music from across the world are a central part of her musical identity the result of an upbringing in which she was taught the piano by air from the age of three by her mother for whom bach beethoven and the beatles were equally valid forms of musical expression an example of her ability not just across but to explode generic boundaries is her twenty oh six album sidewalk dances in which mcgregor collaborates with musicians including saxophonist andy shepherd and indian floor to sri shiram on her arrangements of pieces by the unclassifiable american musician moon dog another of her favorite collaborators is the tunisian singer and wood player dafer youssef their first performance together in the twenty oh nine london jazz festival was described by the times as the future of music merely listing collaborations and plaudits however doesn't do justice to the sheer visceral sense of enjoyment in combining sounds that characterises macgregor's music making music for her is not something safe worthy or respectable but is above all fun this belief was perhaps epitomised in her founding of party in the city as a means both of celebrating the bath international festival and of drawing it to the attention of a much wider audience she has been farsighted too in her understanding of the power of technology to engage new audiences and breakdown barriers to musical communication from her founding of her own record table sound circus in nineteen ninety eight to her embrace of the internet as a means of supporting her students across the world during the pandemic if music is to survive the consequences of the pandemic and the other challenges ahead it will only do so with the sort of energy creativity imagination and sheer panache that joanna mcgregor combines in such a unique way vice chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to the performance and public appreciation of music and the arts i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of music honoris causa on professor joanna mcgregor tay at gradam doctoris music eye honoris kauser promove you curious ray in symbolum superette hope berekum imponent then he congratulations congratulations job well thank you very much everybody just a few words from me i want to thank the vice chancellor for this thrilling honor and also doctor downs for your wonderful eration thank you i feel tired just listening to all that but over thirty years ago i came to saint andrews university and i played a concert i was much younger than i am now obviously and they came to pick me up from the train station it was a very misty dark night and i thought what a romantic place this is and i came and played my recital i can't remember what i played probably something quite modern back then missy anne followed by jonathan harvey with perhaps a bit of bark as an encore and i would never have imagined all these years later that i would be part of this glorious ceremony and and be receiving this enormous honour but most importantly watching a generation of fantastic talent come up onto this stage and i was just thinking as i watched everybody individually how that short brisk walk what it absolutely encapsulates the amount of work dedication commitment to their practice and i want to congratulate all the graduates and also in particular their families and supporters and friends and neighbours and carers who have seen them through these years believing in their enormous talent and dedication for the last two years have been particularly challenging for us all of course and i've been looking after pianists on zoom some of the time but i sort of feel this generation will have enormous resilience actually and huge toughness and inspiration we will all come out of this and i always say to the pianist who arrive because i look after pianists from all over the world at the royal academy of music i say to them i don't just want you to play the piano brilliantly and they look startled because they think that's what they're there for i said no no no no that's not enough i know you can play the piano brilliantly i want you to be a leader i want you to go out into the world and take it over and to use your talent and your gifts in whatever area it is and change things just help us make things better so for a young pianist that will be curating their own concert series starting a record label taking over a festival collaborating teaching speaking about music communication but whatever your degree is in today i wish you not just the very best for your future and i hope that you will take over the world and make it a better place for us all and you'll also become leaders thank you thanks i call upon the assistant vice principal provost professor monique mckenzie vice chancellor graduates and everyone here today it is a great honour to be presenting the graduation address this afternoon i would like to start by saying congratulations on your degree you have worked very hard at a world class university during unprecedented times and you should be very proud of what you have achieved but if we are honest about this the credit for this achievement is in fact shared you will not have achieved this all by yourself somewhere someone or some group have supported you as part of a collective effort to get you here and it is this group i want to talk about today let's call them your family this may include members of your nuclear or first family but it may not and it is likely to include those who have been right beside you for all or part of your degree i would like us to think for a moment about who these people are and for us to think together about what that might mean looking ahead my personal belief is that however you cut it the group these groups of people are what fuel us through our lives and that is regardless of our background i hope that you have all been fortunate in your life so far and that your upbringing was a bit like a disney movie full of unconditional love and opportunity and that this upbringing taught you practical ways to cope with the joys and troubles in life it is easy to see how that start in life as and well propel you forward if instead however you hail from a background more akin to a tim burton movie a rich mix of fantasy and horror much more like mine than also well done to us but we are also lucky that this provides us with the fuel to send us forward a provides the energy to do better live better and be better for ourselves and for those around us and even if you are not someone that tends to dwell on such things the pandemic really has drawn our sense of family into sharp focus for the first time many of us have had to explicitly define who was in and perhaps more painfully who was out of our bubble and this meant thinking carefully about where our supports were and who and the family group would need the contact and help the most during what turned out to be several difficult months and as relationships blossomed or indeed ended this group may have changed shape across time but it was always something we had to publicly fine and even justify if challenged however you define your version of family during your time at saint andrews these close relationships are likely to stay with us for years to come as part of my slightly misshapen but perfectly formed family i got to recently experience a version of the saint andrews bubble first hand possibly something like your bubble might be in about two years time and on tour coincidentally i was at a wedding where two saint andrews graduates were getting married they had met at saint andrews and we're continuing the tradition of a post degree saint andrews marriage something you're almost promised at your welcome ceremony at this event i had the pleasure of meeting a vibrant group of saint andrews alumni he would gather around this young couple and were forming a family of their own and despite being on the periphery of that group the love and belonging in that farmhouse barn and dare i say it on the dance floor was enough to move you to tears in some sense your new degree has now joined your family group it is part of who you have become and you can choose how or if you nurture the academic relationship you have established but unlike the flesh and blood element of your family you are free to feed or starve this family member as you please in the years to come you may engorge this loved one or see it deflate into oblivion and if i'm ever asked for advice on this i would always suggest that you do what you love if that is furthering your studies then do it but if it's moving on to new things do that instead i find that people shine when they do what they love and when we shine it can illuminate pathways we otherwise would not have seen as i age i've also learned to be open minded about the membership of this family group and to invest in relationships both at home and at work i learned quite by surprise actually that this notion of family can extend to your place of work and over the last twenty years at saint andrews i have been incredibly lucky to work beside a small group of wonderful people who are now firmly part of what i consider my family we are there for each other during days nights pandemic or otherwise and in the spirit of not wasting a good crisis the pandemic has also led me to extend my close group of friends as part of the cando project in response to covid nineteen relatedly the pandemic has also been a friendly reminder for me to nurture these relationships life tends to be pretty

avita maternal consequent periosteum christum dominum nostrum amen please be seated good afternoon it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees new professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year period in which they were necessarily hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome you today and address you directly and i'm sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends colleagues and loved ones in the usual way it certainly means a great deal to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations our venue today as you know is the university of saint andrews sports centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929 the younger hall has been closed since july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building is fully accessible to all its users our current utilization of the sports centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the scottish government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic within those legal guidelines all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when roving moving around the venue that includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees an exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony they are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks i have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have removed my face covering for the duration you are entitled of course to remove your covering upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors but we must ask you to replace them please for the graduation reception this afternoon at which you must wear a covering when inside the marquee unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for formal photos are welcome of course to remove your coverings when the photographer asks you to say cheese what these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenge of our time and i find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder of how far we have come and of the respect and consideration that we at saint andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic the sports centre is a fitting reminder of that too sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic but our sports centre and it's over 50 clubs are once again operating at full capacity this parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at saint andrews both our students association and its over 130 societies and the brand new laidlaw music centre are offering their full range of opportunities indeed we are hopeful that these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the danimal of the pandemic years marking our hopeful transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we have now an elevated appreciation the university of saint andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the national student survey a UK wide collection of student feedback saint andrews has placed first for student satisfaction for each of the past six years including this one in which we were also the only university in the country to attain over 90% satisfaction this success was paralleled by the times and sunday times good university guide for 2022 in which saint andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed first ahead of both oxford and cambridge those two attainments the pandemic notwithstanding are a powerful testament to what we do here the quality of our teaching but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students our graduates will thus receive their degrees from scotland and the UK's premier university as well as scotland's oldest saint andrews is the third oldest university in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest anywhere the tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of our ceremony the first of these you have already witnessed as since salvatore's chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudi armas and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans internal in in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and i should perhaps say in parenthesis that it is regularly dry cleaned and it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption other place within a long lineage of saint andrews alumni when the conferrals are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we're thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to the induction of new professors after which we will confer an honorary degree upon today's guest of honour professor joanna mcgregor whom we recognise today to close our ceremony it is tradition that the university invites a guest to address our new graduates to inspire them and to wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives today's guest speaker is professor monique mckenzie assistant vice principal and provost the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession here in saint andrews the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 608 years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artists

part of our graduation tradition academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries most notably between european and american models at saint andrews the first academic posting is conventionally a lectureship and lecturers become senior lecturers then readers as they progress up the ladder although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement the pursuit of excellence and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field it is a significant pinnacle in an academic career we thus recognise and formally induct our new professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can all celebrate i will call forth the new professors and they will be inducted into the prophecy oriat with prescribed latin phrases each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction the academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students including some of those who have just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines promoting the transmission of ideas generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence let us recognise their successes now on the instruction of the sonatas academicas of which i declare this a duly constituted meeting i will now install its newly appointed professors

of music vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of music or norris karza professor joanna mcgregor the last 21 months have been a period of existential crisis for music demanding resilience and versatility intelligence and imagination as never before from those who practice it it is difficult to think of a musician anywhere in the world who better exemplifies those qualities than joanna macgregor her career not only inspires all who care about music but also illuminates how the art form itself may continue to thrive joanna mcgregor is one of the world's leading pianists she has performed in over 80 countries across the world working with conductors such as pierre boulez valerie gergiev and simon rattle she is renowned for her expertise and contemporary music encouraging composers as distinguished and diverse as john adams and harrison birtwistle jango bates and james mcmillan to create music for her but she is equally at home in the canonical works of the piano repertoire her recordings include bachs goldberg variations and the art of fugue and the complete shop ann mazurkas and her project in between the two lockdowns last autumn was the astonishing feat of playing all 32 of beethoven's piano sonatas across only three days at the canterbury festival for the last 20 years she has also been active as a conductor and has directed concerts with the royal philharmonic the royal liverpool philharmonic the britain symphonia and the halle among other orchestras she has recently taken up a new post as music director of the brighton philharmonic orchestra judging on the basis of her first season which includes collaborations with the northumbrian piper catherine tickel macgregor's own orchestrations of astor piazzolla and live and improvisations to silent films and culminates with her playing brahms first piano concerto under the direction of shawn edwards st andrews honorary professor of conducting sussex audiences are in for an exciting time as their orchestra approaches its centenary year joanna macgregor's genius for creating stimulating musical juxtapositions has also been displayed in her roles as artistic director of the dartington international summer school and festival and of the bath international music festival as well as an event she has created for organizations including the royal opera house the new york philharmonic and yenching's contemporary dance theatre of shanghai she is deeply committed to music education she is a professor of the university of london and head of piano at the royal academy of music where she runs an annual summer festival for young musicians and she has written a highly praised series of teaching books for young children entitled piano world for favour music and to add yet another role to those of pianist conductor festival director broadcaster record producer composer and teacher in 2019 joanna mcgregor was one of the judges for the booker prize impressive though this list of joanna macgregor's many roles is what is truly inspiring is the youth she has made of them to inculcate excitement about music in others she has been working across multiple genres and using technology to promote music in new ways long before it was fashionable or necessary to do so collaborations with musicians working in jazz and pop dance and film folk and traditional music from across the world are a central part of her musical identity the result of an upbringing in which she was taught the piano by air from the age of three by her mother for whom bach beethoven and the beatles were equally valid forms of musical expression an example of her ability not just across but to explode generic boundaries is her twenty 06 album sidewalk dances in which mcgregor collaborates with musicians including saxophonist andy shepherd and indian floor to sri shiram on her arrangements of pieces by the unclassifiable american musician moon dog another of her favorite collaborators is the tunisian singer and wood player dafer youssef their first performance together in the twenty 09 london jazz festival was described by the times as the future of music merely listing collaborations and plaudits however doesn't do justice to the sheer visceral sense of enjoyment in combining sounds that characterises macgregor's music making music for her is not something safe worthy or respectable but is above all fun this belief was perhaps epitomised in her founding of party in the city as a means both of celebrating the bath international festival and of drawing it to the attention of a much wider audience she has been farsighted too in her understanding of the power of technology to engage new audiences and breakdown barriers to musical communication from her founding of her own record table sound circus in 1998 to her embrace of the internet as a means of supporting her students across the world during the pandemic if music is to survive the consequences of the pandemic and the other challenges ahead it will only do so with the sort of energy creativity imagination and sheer panache that joanna mcgregor combines in such a unique way vice chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to the performance and public appreciation of music and the arts i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of music honoris causa on professor joanna mcgregor tay at gradam doctoris music eye honoris kauser promove you curious ray in symbolum superette hope berekum imponent then he congratulations congratulations job well thank you very much everybody just a few words from me i want to thank the vice chancellor for this thrilling honor and also doctor downs for your wonderful eration thank you i feel tired just listening to all that but over 30 years ago i came to saint andrews university and i played a concert i was much younger than i am now obviously and they came to pick me up from the train station it was a very misty dark night and i thought what a romantic place this is and i came and played my recital i can't remember what i played probably something quite modern back then missy anne followed by jonathan harvey with perhaps a bit of bark as an encore and i would never have imagined all these years later that i would be part of this glorious ceremony and and be receiving this enormous honour but most importantly watching a generation of fantastic talent come up onto this stage and i was just thinking as i watched everybody individually how that short brisk walk what it absolutely encapsulates the amount of work dedication commitment to their practice and i want to congratulate all the graduates and also in particular their families and supporters and friends and neighbours and carers who have seen them through these years believing in their enormous talent and dedication for the last two years have been particularly challenging for us all of course and i've been looking after pianists on zoom some of the time but i sort of feel this generation will have enormous resilience actually and huge toughness and inspiration we will all come out of this and i always say to the pianist who arrive because i look after pianists from all over the world at the royal academy of music i say to them i don't just want you to play the piano brilliantly and they look startled because they think that's what they're there for i said no no no no that's not enough i know you can play the piano brilliantly i want you to be a leader i want you to go out into the world and take it over and to use your talent and your gifts in whatever area it is and change things just help us make things better so for a young pianist that will be curating their own concert series starting a record label taking over a festival collaborating teaching speaking about music communication but whatever your degree is in today i wish you not just the very best for your future and i hope that you will take over the world and make it a better place for us all and you'll also become leaders thank you thanks i call upon the assistant vice principal provost professor monique mckenzie vice chancellor graduates and everyone here today it is a great honour to be presenting the graduation address this afternoon i would like to start by saying congratulations on your degree you have worked very hard at a world class university during unprecedented times and you should be very proud of what you have achieved but if we are honest about this the credit for this achievement is in fact shared you will not have achieved this all by yourself somewhere someone or some group have supported you as part of a collective effort to get you here and it is this group i want to talk about today let's call them your family this may include members of your nuclear or first family but it may not and it is likely to include those who have been right beside you for all or part of your degree i would like us to think for a moment about who these people are and for us to think together about what that might mean looking ahead my personal belief is that however you cut it the group these groups of people are what fuel us through our lives and that is regardless of our background i hope that you have all been fortunate in your life so far and that your upbringing was a bit like a disney movie full of unconditional love and opportunity and that this upbringing taught you practical ways to cope with the joys and troubles in life it is easy to see how that start in life as and well propel you forward if instead however you hail from a background more akin to a tim burton movie a rich mix of fantasy and horror much more like mine than also well done to us but we are also lucky that this provides us with the fuel to send us forward a provides the energy to do better live better and be better for ourselves and for those around us and even if you are not someone that tends to dwell on such things the pandemic really has drawn our sense of family into sharp focus for the first time many of us have had to explicitly define who was in and perhaps more painfully who was out of our bubble and this meant thinking carefully about where our supports were and who and the family group would need the contact and help the most during what turned out to be several difficult months and as relationships blossomed or indeed ended this group may have changed shape across time but it was always something we had to publicly fine and even justify if challenged however you define your version of family during your time at saint andrews these close relationships are likely to stay with us for years to come as part of my slightly misshapen but perfectly formed family i got to recently experience a version of the saint andrews bubble first hand possibly something like your bubble might be in about 2 years time and on tour coincidentally i was at a wedding where 2 saint andrews graduates were getting married they had met at saint andrews and we're continuing the tradition of a post degree saint andrews marriage something you're almost promised at your welcome ceremony at this event i had the pleasure of meeting a vibrant group of saint andrews alumni he would gather around this young couple and were forming a family of their own and despite being on the periphery of that group the love and belonging in that farmhouse barn and dare i say it on the dance floor was enough to move you to tears in some sense your new degree has now joined your family group it is part of who you have become and you can choose how or if you nurture the academic relationship you have established but unlike the flesh and blood element of your family you are free to feed or starve this family member as you please in the years to come you may engorge this loved one or see it deflate into oblivion and if i'm ever asked for advice on this i would always suggest that you do what you love if that is furthering your studies then do it but if it's moving on to new things do that instead i find that people shine when they do what they love and when we shine it can illuminate pathways we otherwise would not have seen as i age i've also learned to be open minded about the membership of this family group and to invest in relationships both at home and at work i learned quite by surprise actually that this notion of family can extend to your place of work and over the last 20 years at saint andrews i have been incredibly lucky to work beside a small group of wonderful people who are now firmly part of what i consider my family we

At the end of the graduation ceremony, all our new graduates will join the academic procession, leaving the graduation hall and walking around the running track before entering the graduation marquee. Now to those who are supporting today. Please wait until all our new graduates have left the hall. Ushers will then show you to the nearest exits. Outside you will be directed to where you'll be able to join our new graduates. In the marquee. In the event of the fire alarm sounding during the ceremony, which we do not anticipate happening. Please remain seated. Staff will direct you accordingly and you will be asked to leave the hall and assemble outside should that be necessary. Please ensure that your mobile phone is switched off. And please remain seated throughout the ceremony and refrain from taking photographs or recordings of people not in your immediate group.

Good afternoon, it is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees. New professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year. In which they were necessarily hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus, with a renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome you today and address you directly, and I'm sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, colleagues and loved ones in the usual way. It certainly means a great deal to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations. Our venue today, as you know, is the University of Saint Andrews Sports Centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall, which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929. The younger hall has been closed since July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building. Is fully accessible to all its users. Our current utilization of the Sports Centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the Scottish Government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic. Within those legal guidelines, all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when roving, moving around the venue. That includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees. An exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony. They are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks. I have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have removed my face covering for the duration. You are entitled, of course, to remove your covering upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors. But we must ask you to replace them please for the graduation reception this afternoon at which you must wear a covering when inside the marquee. Unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for formal photos are welcome. Of course, to remove your coverings. When the photographer asks you to say cheese. What these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenge of our time, and I find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder of how far we have come and of the respect and consideration that we, at Saint Andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic. The Sports Centre is a fitting reminder of that too. Sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic, but our sports centre and it's over 50 clubs are once again operating at full capacity. This parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at Saint Andrews. Both our students association and its over 130 societies and the brand new Laidlaw Music Centre are offering their full range. Of opportunities. Indeed, we are hopeful that these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the danimal of the pandemic years, marking our hopeful transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary, progress with kindness and respect, and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we have now an elevated appreciation. The University of Saint Andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the National Student Survey, a UK wide collection of student feedback, Saint Andrews has placed first for student satisfaction for each of the past six years, including this one in which we were also the only university in the country to attain over 90% satisfaction. This success was paralleled by the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide for 2022, in which Saint Andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed first ahead of both Oxford and Cambridge. Those two attainments, the pandemic notwithstanding, are a powerful testament to what we do here. The quality of our teaching, but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students. Our graduates will thus receive their degrees from Scotland and the UK's Premier University, as well as Scotland's oldest. Saint Andrews is the third oldest university in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest anywhere. The tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of our ceremony. The first of these you have already witnessed as since Salvatore's Chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the Gaudi Armas and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer as Vice Chancellor. I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow this introduction. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition, I will call upon the Deans internal in in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and I then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts. And to symbolise this, I place upon you this cap to most, though we simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews Taylor and I should perhaps say in parenthesis that it is regularly dry cleaned. And it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption. Other place within a long lineage of Saint Andrews alumni. When the Conferrals are complete, since our veterans Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we're thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins, for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to the induction of new professors, after which we will confer an honorary degree upon today's guest of honour. Professor Joanna McGregor, whom we recognise today. To close our ceremony, it is tradition that the university invites a guest to address our new graduates, to inspire them and to wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives. Today's guest speaker is Professor Monique McKenzie, Assistant vice principal and Provost. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. Here in Saint Andrews, the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 608 years and who support one another in the present. So while you were graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life. Decanus faculty artists Artsiom.

Academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries, most notably between European and American models. At Saint Andrews, the first academic posting is conventionally a lectureship and lecturers become senior lecturers, then readers as they progress up the ladder, although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice. Professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly, and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement, the pursuit of excellence, and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field. It is a significant pinnacle in an academic career. We thus recognise and formally induct our new professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can all celebrate. I will call forth the new professors and they will be inducted into the Prophecy Oriat with prescribed Latin phrases. Each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime. Committed to the written word, each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice, which is gifted to them by the university. And presented out with this ceremony the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction. The academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students, including some of those who have just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines, promoting the transmission of ideas, generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence. Let us recognise their successes now. On the instruction of the sonatas academicas, of which I declare this a duly constituted meeting, I will now install its newly appointed professors. Quando quidam in Universitate Sancti Andrei Vacui Sound high, professor Yonis there were a number of vacant appointments in several schools at the university.

The university court felt it correct to entrust the duties of these appointments to the following colleagues and the professors and masters of the university were in agreement. I will now summon those forward who are to be installed. Professor Linda Goddard School of Art history. Professor Daniel Clayton School of Geography and Sustainable Development. Professor Nisa Finney School of Geography and Sustainable development. Professor Vivian Wilde, School of Physics and astronomy. Pelagon to diplomata. I now request that the certificates are read out.

This states you have been a lot of Sparta. Do it credit. I call upon Doctor Michael Downes, director of music. Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Music or Norris Karza. Professor Joanna McGregor. The last 21 months have been a period of existential crisis for music. Demanding resilience and versatility, intelligence and imagination as never before. From those who practice it, it is difficult to think of a musician anywhere in the world who better exemplifies those qualities than Joanna MacGregor. Her career not only inspires all who care about music, but also illuminates how the art form itself may continue to thrive. Joanna McGregor is one of the world's leading pianists. She has performed in over 80 countries across the world, working with conductors such as Pierre Boulez, Valerie Gergiev and Simon Rattle. She is renowned for her expertise and contemporary music, encouraging composers as distinguished and diverse as John Adams and Harrison Birtwistle. Jango Bates and James McMillan to create music for her. But she is equally at home in the canonical works of the piano repertoire. Her recordings include Bachs Goldberg Variations and the art of Fugue and the complete shop Ann mazurkas and her project in between the two lockdowns last autumn. Was the astonishing feat of playing all 32 of Beethoven's piano sonatas across only three days at the Canterbury Festival. For the last 20 years, she has also been active as a conductor and has directed concerts with the Royal Philharmonic, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Britain, Symphonia and the Halle, among other orchestras. She has recently taken up a new post as music director of the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra. Judging on the basis of her first season, which includes collaborations with the Northumbrian Piper, Catherine Tickel, Macgregor's own orchestrations of Ástor Piazzolla and live and improvisations to silent films and culminates with her playing Brahms first Piano Concerto under the direction of Shawn Edwards. St. Andrews, Honorary professor of conducting Sussex audiences are in for an exciting time as their orchestra approaches its centenary year. Joanna Macgregor's genius for creating stimulating musical juxtapositions has also been displayed in her roles as Artistic director of the Dartington International Summer School and Festival and of the Bath International Music Festival as well as an event she has created for organizations including the Royal Opera House, the New York Philharmonic and Yenching's Contemporary Dance Theatre of Shanghai. She is deeply committed to music education. She is a professor of the University of London and Head of piano at the Royal Academy of Music, where she runs an annual summer festival for young musicians, and she has written a highly praised series of teaching books for young children entitled Piano World for favour music. And to add yet another role to those of pianist, conductor festival, director, broadcaster, record producer, composer and teacher in 2019. Joanna McGregor was one of the judges for the Booker prize. Impressive though this list of Joanna Macgregor's many roles is what is truly inspiring is the youth she has made of them to inculcate excitement about music in others. She has been working across multiple genres and using technology to promote music in new ways long before it was fashionable or necessary to do so. Collaborations with musicians working in jazz and pop dance and film, folk and traditional music from across the world are a central part of her musical identity, the result of an upbringing in which she was taught the piano by air from the age of three by her mother, for whom Bach, Beethoven and The Beatles were equally valid forms of musical expression. An example of her ability not just across but to explode generic boundaries is her twenty 06 album sidewalk dances, in which McGregor collaborates with musicians, including saxophonist Andy Shepherd and Indian floor to Sri Shiram. On her arrangements of pieces by the unclassifiable American musician Moon dog. Another of her favorite collaborators is the Tunisian singer and wood player Dafer Youssef. Their first performance together in the Twenty 09 London Jazz Festival was described by the times as the future of music. Merely listing collaborations and plaudits, however doesn't do justice to the sheer visceral sense of enjoyment in combining sounds that characterises Macgregor's music making. Music for her is not something safe, worthy or respectable, but is above all fun. This belief was perhaps epitomised in her founding of party in the city as a means both of celebrating the Bath International Festival and of drawing it to the attention of a much wider audience. She has been farsighted too, in her understanding of the power of technology to engage new audiences and breakdown barriers to musical communication. From her founding of her own record. Table sound circus in 1998 to her embrace of the Internet as a means of supporting her students across the world during the pandemic. If music is to survive, the consequences of the pandemic and the other challenges ahead, it will only do so with the sort of energy, creativity, imagination, and sheer panache that Joanna McGregor combines in such a unique way. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of her major contribution to the performance and public appreciation of music and the arts, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Music, honoris causa on Professor Joanna McGregor.

Well, thank you very much everybody. Just a few words from me. I want to thank the Vice Chancellor for this thrilling honor and also doctor Downs for your wonderful eration. Thank you. I feel tired just listening to all that. But over 30 years ago I came to Saint Andrews University and I played a concert. I was much younger than I am now, obviously, and they came to pick me up from the train station. It was a very misty dark night and I thought what a romantic place this is. And I came and played my recital. I can't remember what I played, probably something quite modern back then. Missy Anne, followed by Jonathan Harvey with perhaps a bit of bark as an encore and I would never have imagined all these years later that I would be part of this glorious ceremony and and be receiving this enormous honour. But most importantly, watching a generation of fantastic talent come up onto this stage and I was just thinking as I watched everybody individually, how that short brisk walk? What it absolutely encapsulates the amount of work, dedication, commitment to their practice. And I want to congratulate all the graduates and also in particular their families and supporters and friends and neighbours and carers who have seen them through these years believing in their enormous talent. And dedication for the last two years have been particularly challenging for us all, of course, and I've been looking after pianists on zoom some of the time, but I sort of feel this generation will have enormous resilience, actually, and huge toughness and inspiration. We will all come out of this and I always say to the pianist who arrive because I look after pianists from all over the world at the Royal Academy of Music. I say to them, I don't just want you to play the piano brilliantly, and they look startled because they think that's what they're there for. I said no, no no, no, that's not enough. I know you can play the piano brilliantly. I want you to be a leader. I want you to go out into the world and take it over and to use your talent and your gifts in whatever area it is and change things. Just help us make things better. So for a young pianist that will be curating their own concert series, starting a record label, taking over a festival, collaborating, teaching, speaking about music, communication. But whatever your degree is in today, I wish you not just the very best for your future. And I hope that you will take over the world and make it a better place for us all, and you'll also become leaders. Thank you thanks. I call upon the Assistant Vice principal Provost, Professor Monique McKenzie. Vice chancellor graduates and everyone here. Today. It is a great honour to be presenting the graduation address. This afternoon. I would like to start by saying congratulations on your degree. You have worked very hard at a world class university during unprecedented times and you should be very proud of what you have achieved. But if we are honest about this, the credit for this achievement is in fact shared. You will not have achieved this all by yourself somewhere. Someone or some group have supported you as part of a collective effort to get you here and it is this group I want to talk about today. Let's call them your family. This may include members of your nuclear or first family, but it may not and it is likely to include those who have been right beside you for all or part of your degree. I would like us to think for a moment about who these people are and for us to think together about what that might mean. Looking ahead, my personal belief is that however you cut it, the group these groups of people are what fuel us through our lives. And that is regardless of our background. I hope that you have all been fortunate in your life so far and that your upbringing was a bit like a Disney movie full of unconditional love and opportunity, and that this upbringing taught you practical ways to cope with the joys and troubles in life. It is easy to see how that start in life. As and well, propel you forward. If instead however you hail from a background more akin to a Tim Burton movie, a rich mix of fantasy and horror, much more like mine than also well done to us. But we are also lucky that this provides us with the fuel to send us forward. A provides the energy to do better, live better, and be better for ourselves and for those around us. And even if you are not someone that tends to dwell on such things. The pandemic really has drawn our sense of family into sharp focus. For the first time, many of us have had to explicitly define who was in, and perhaps more painfully, who was out of our bubble, and this meant thinking carefully about where our supports were and who and the family group would need the contact and help the most during what turned out to be several difficult months. And as relationships blossomed, or indeed ended, this group may have changed shape across time, but it was always something we had to publicly. Fine and even justify if challenged. However, you define your version of family during your time at Saint Andrews. These close relationships are likely to stay with us for years to come. As part of my slightly misshapen but perfectly formed family, I got to recently experience a version of the Saint Andrews Bubble, first hand, possibly something like your bubble might be in about 2 years time, and on tour. Coincidentally, I was at a wedding where 2 Saint Andrews graduates were getting married. They had met at Saint Andrews, and we're continuing the tradition of a post degree Saint Andrews marriage. Something you're almost promised at your welcome ceremony at this event, I had the pleasure of meeting a vibrant group of Saint Andrews alumni. He would gather around this young couple and were forming a family of their own. And despite being on the periphery of that group, the love and belonging in that farmhouse barn, and dare I say it on the dance floor was enough to move you to tears. In some sense, your new degree has now joined your family group. It is part of who you have become, and you can choose how or if you nurture the academic relationship you have established. But unlike the flesh and blood element of your family, you are free to feed or starve this family member as you please. In the years to come, you may engorge this loved one or see it deflate into oblivion. And if I'm ever asked for advice on this, I would always suggest that you do what you love, if that is furthering your studies, then do it. But if it's moving on to new things, do that instead. I find that people shine when they do what they love and when we shine it can illuminate pathways we otherwise would not have seen. As I age, I've also learned to be open minded about the membership of this family group and to invest in relationships both at home and at work. I learned quite by surprise, actually, that this notion of family can extend to your place of work and over the last 20 years at Saint Andrews, I have been incredibly lucky to work beside a small group of wonderful people who are now firmly part of what I consider my family. We are there for each other during days, nights, pandemic or otherwise, and in the spirit of not wasting a good crisis. The pandemic has also led me to extend my close group of friends as part of the Cando project. In response to COVID-19. Relatedly, the pandemic has also been a friendly reminder for me to nurture these relationships. Life tends to be pretty good at interrupting our carefully drafted plans with reminders about our mortality, and I have been reminded not. To allow my loved ones to fade into the background behind my diary commitments. Because those people will be the ones who will be there for you and you for them, regardless of what's in that diary. And through life's difficult landscapes with their charged emotional fields. So in the spirit of Mapstone condensed build on this achievement, you were rewarded today using the fuel from whatever background you inherited. Do what you love nourish the relationships you have created. With your time, your love and be generous and cherish these shared experiences, keep an open mind about who might join your family and find reasons to keep sharing time with these lovely people, even if that means finding community in a crisis. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Oremus Grazia Domini Nostri Yasuke, cristi. At Caritas day, at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, sit Kumon, minibus nobis in secular secularism. Ohmen"
