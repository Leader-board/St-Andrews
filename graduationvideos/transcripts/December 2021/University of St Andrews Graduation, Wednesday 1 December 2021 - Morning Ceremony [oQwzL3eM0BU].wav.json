my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees new professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year period in which they were necessarily hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome you today and address you directly and i am sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends with colleagues and with loved ones in the usual way it certainly means a great deal to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations our venue today as you will all know is the university of saint andrews sports centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall has been closed since july two thousand and nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building is fully accessible to all users our current utilization of the sports centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the scottish government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic within those vehicle guidelines all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when moving about the venue that includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees an exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks i have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have removed my face covering for the duration you are entitled of course to remove your covering upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors but we must ask that you replace them for the graduation reception this afternoon at which if you attend you must wear a covering when inside the marquee unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for for formal photos are welcome to remove your coverings when the photographer asks you to say cheese what these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenges of our time and i find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder of how far we have come and of the respect and consideration that we at saint andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic the sports centre is a fitting reminder of that too sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic but our sports centre and its over fifty clubs are once again operating at full capacity this parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at saint andrews both our students association and its over one hundred and thirty societies and the brand brand new laidlaw music centre are offering their full range of opportunities indeed let us hope that these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the denormal of the pandemic years marking we hope our transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we do have now an elevated appreciation the university of saint andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the national student survey a UK wide collection of student feedback saint andrews has placed first four student satisfaction for each of the past six years including this one in which we were also the only university in the country to attain over ninety percent satisfaction this success was paralleled by the times and sunday times good university guide for twenty twenty two in which saint andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed first ahead of both oxford and cambridge those two attainments the pandemic not withstanding are a powerful testament to what we do here the quality of our teaching but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students our graduates will thus receive their degrees from scotland and the UK 's premier university as well as scotland 's oldest saint andrews is the third oldest university in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest anywhere the tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony the first of these you have already witnessed as saint servatus chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudi armours and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say ET super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or beraten touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and i paused to reassure you that it has been regularly dry cleaned ever since and it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of the place with a long lineage of saint andrews alumni when the conferrals are complete since of eighties chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed to the induction of new university professors to close our ceremony it is tradition that the university invites a guest to address our new graduates to inspire them and to wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives today's guest speaker is doctor karen brown from the school of art history the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession around the running track here in saint andrews the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduations are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and eight years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you were not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is

our graduation tradition academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries most notably between europe and american models at saint andrews the first academic posting is conventionally electric ship and lecturers become senior lecturers then readers as they progress up the ladder although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement the pursuit of excellence and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field it is a significant pinnacle in an academic career alongside the introduction in induction of new professors today we will also mark the appointment of a bishop wardlaw professor the title of bishop wardlaw professor is bestowed by the university court upon academics who have been elected as a fellow of one of the united kingdoms two leading learned societies the british academy for scholars in the arts and humanities and the royal society for science and medicine scholars membership of either of these bodies is extremely prestigious and an honour attained only by the leading academics of our time the title takes its name from the founder of our university bishop henry wardlaw to recognise that those who carry it participate in a tradition of scholarly excellence established over six hundred years ago prior to this graduation session there have been just twenty one bishop ward law professors at the university since the position was introduced in nineteen ninety seven we thus recognise and formally induct our new professors and bishop ward law professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can celebrate i will call for the new professors and they will be inducted into the professoriate with prescribed latin phrases each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction the academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students including some of those who have just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines promoting the transmission of ideas generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence let us recognise their successes now on the instruction of the senatus academicas of which i declare this a fully constituted meeting i shall now install its newly appointed professors quando quidam in university sancti andrei vacui sound high

cicero this states you have been allotted sparta do it credit i call upon doctor karen brown of the school of art history vice chancellor graduates staff and guests warmest congratulations to all our new graduates their families and friends gathered here marking your graduation from the university of saint andrews it's time to celebrate your achievements and enjoy this rite of passage experienced by fellow alumni for more than six hundred years in this small but dramatic medieval town of saint andrews i've learned on good authority that there are thirty five different countries represented at a ceremony today illustrating the point that saint andrews is a university that's in the words of scottish polymath sir patrick gettis can think global in reach and ambition but act local in delivery of excellent teaching learning and student experience in the course of your studies you required a whole range of skills that will now hold you in good stead for your future but of course not all of these are academic during your time here many of you have engaged in societies for sport music environmental justice social diversity and other interests leading to the enrichment of your lives and the development of friendships with the like minded people moreover in studying during the covid nineteen restrictions you have shown your ability to adapt to unpredictable change consider together these are the skills that will be essential for the wider world that you are now embarking upon as you leave these chilly shores of fife this december to follow your hopes and dreams my own hopes and dreams were created where i studied at trinity college in dublin a community that still holds a very special special place in my heart for the friendships and memories made there ranging from discoveries in the archives to days in pubs spent with friends talking about literature of theology the arts or sneaking through front arch in the dark to return to the safe haven of rooms escaping the noise and excitement of dublin at night i didn't know at that point that i would go on to becoming an academic living in scotland specializing in community museums in europe latin america and the caribbean but when i look back i believe it's largely the values and beliefs that i learned at trinity that honed my path thanks mainly to turkey professors i learned the values of being true to yourself of following your gut instincts and of having faith that life is unfolding as it should even when it doesn't work out as you expected as WB yates reflected when looking at portraits of irish cultural leaders in the municipal gallery my glory was i had such friends these are also the qualities that i've recognized in the community museum leaders that i've had the privilege to work with in latin america and if i may i'd like to take this occasion to share some wisdom learnt from one very special indigenous woman and elder from costa rica who drove the creation of their community museum for over thirty years and who also rather amazingly came here to speak at the byre theatre as well as in portree high school in the isle of skye this wisdom is to honour ancestral memories and to keep them alive to have a clear vision that's of benefit for the collective good to practice practice collective forms of decision making to have faith in a spiritual force that's greater than yourself to be patient for you will get there slowly little by little and finally to have fun and make time to celebrate with european unity i suspect that i've tested your patients well enough by now after this long ceremony and you can't wait to go on and celebrate your own successes but i would like to take one little moment to commend graduate lioni leader whom i had the privilege to supervise for attaining the saunders memorial prize today for her thesis on indigenous cultural heritage and decolonisation but to return to where we began today today is a moment marking new horizons for each of you at a time when you're likely to be experiencing a mixture of excitement and nervousness i hope that following your well deserved festivities today and before you leave you'll pause to take one more look out over the vista of the north sea and reflect upon what memories you may hold on to from our small university town memories that have made you who you are today through the hard times and the good values formed together with us your teachers and support staff as an academic community and change so congratulations once again all the very best for your futures and please stay in touch thank you please stand for the benediction or abuse gratia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism amen",

academic structures vary between countries most notably between europe and american models at saint andrews the first academic posting is conventionally electric ship and lecturers become senior lecturers then readers as they progress up the ladder although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement the pursuit of excellence and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field it is a significant pinnacle in an academic career alongside the introduction in induction of new professors today we will also mark the appointment of a bishop wardlaw professor the title of bishop wardlaw professor is bestowed by the university court upon academics who have been elected as a fellow of one of the united kingdoms 2 leading learned societies the british academy for scholars in the arts and humanities and the royal society for science and medicine scholars membership of either of these bodies is extremely prestigious and an honour attained only by the leading academics of our time the title takes its name from the founder of our university bishop henry wardlaw to recognise that those who carry it participate in a tradition of scholarly excellence established over 600 years ago prior to this graduation session there have been just 21 bishop ward law professors at the university since the position was introduced in 1997 we thus recognise and formally induct our new professors and bishop ward law professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can celebrate i will call for the new professors and they will be inducted into the professoriate with prescribed latin phrases each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony the books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction the academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students including some of those who have just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines promoting the transmission of ideas generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence let us recognise their successes now on the instruction of the senatus academicas of which i declare this a fully constituted meeting i shall now

graduates staff and guests warmest congratulations to all our new graduates their families and friends gathered here marking your graduation from the university of saint andrews it's time to celebrate your achievements and enjoy this rite of passage experienced by fellow alumni for more than 600 years in this small but dramatic medieval town of saint andrews i've learned on good authority that there are 35 different countries represented at a ceremony today illustrating the point that saint andrews is a university that's in the words of scottish polymath sir patrick gettis can think global in reach and ambition but act local in delivery of excellent teaching learning and student experience in the course of your studies you required a whole range of skills that will now hold you in good stead for your future but of course not all of these are academic during your time here many of you have engaged in societies for sport music environmental justice social diversity and other interests leading to the enrichment of your lives and the development of friendships with the like minded people moreover in studying during the COVID-19 restrictions you have shown your ability to adapt to unpredictable change consider together these are the skills that will be essential for the wider world that you are now embarking upon as you leave these chilly shores of fife this december to follow your hopes and dreams my own hopes and dreams were created where i studied at trinity college in dublin a community that still holds a very special special place in my heart for the friendships and memories made there ranging from discoveries in the archives to days in pubs spent with friends talking about literature of theology the arts or sneaking through front arch in the dark to return to the safe haven of rooms escaping the noise and excitement of dublin at night i didn't know at that point that i would go on to becoming an academic living in scotland specializing in community museums in europe latin america and the caribbean but when i look back i believe it's largely the values and beliefs that i learned at trinity that honed my path thanks mainly to turkey professors i learned the values of being true to yourself of following your gut instincts and of having faith that life is unfolding as it should even when it doesn't work out as you expected as WB yates reflected when looking at portraits of irish cultural leaders in the municipal gallery my glory was i had such friends these are also the qualities that i've recognized in the community museum leaders that i've had the privilege to work with in latin america and if i may i'd like to take this occasion to share some wisdom learnt from one very special indigenous woman and elder from costa rica who drove the creation of their community museum for over 30 years and who also rather amazingly came here to speak at the byre theatre as well as in portree high school in the isle of skye this wisdom is to honour ancestral memories and to keep them alive to have a clear vision that's of benefit for the collective good to practice practice collective forms of decision making to have faith in a spiritual force that's greater than yourself to be patient for you will get there slowly little by little and finally to have fun and make time to celebrate with european unity i suspect that i've tested your patients well enough by now after this long ceremony and you can't wait to go on and celebrate your own successes but i would like to take one little moment to commend graduate lioni leader whom i had the privilege to supervise for attaining the saunders memorial prize today for her thesis on indigenous cultural heritage and decolonisation but to return to where we began today today is a moment marking new horizons for each of you at a time when you're likely to be experiencing a mixture of excitement and nervousness i hope that following your well deserved festivities today and before you leave you'll pause to take one more look out over the vista of the north sea and reflect upon what memories you may hold on to from our small university town memories that have made you who you are today through the hard times and the good values formed together with us your teachers and support staff as an academic community and change so congratulations once again all the very best for your futures and please stay in touch thank you please stand for the benediction or abuse gratia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular

      "display": "May I have your attention please? Good morning graduates, friends, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Donald McEwen and I'm the chaplain to the university.

At the end of the graduation ceremony, our all our new graduates will join the academic procession. They'll leave the graduation hall and walk around the running track before entering the graduation marquee. To everyone else here, Please wait until all our new graduates have left the hall. Ushers will then show you to the nearest exits outside. You will be directed to where you'll be able to join our new graduates in the marquee. In the event of a fire alarm sounding during the ceremony, which we do not anticipate happening, please remain seated. Staff will direct you accordingly and you will be asked to leave the hall and assemble outside should that be necessary. Please ensure that your mobile phone is switched off. And please remain seated throughout the ceremony and refrained from taking photographs or recordings of people who are not in your immediate group.

It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this winter graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees. New professors are inducted and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a two year. In which they were necessarily hosted online. Due to the pandemic, it is thus with a renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome you today and address you directly, and I am sure that the joyfulness of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends with colleagues and with loved ones. In the usual way. It certainly means a great deal to the academics and staff who have supported our students that they can participate in these celebrations. Our venue today, as you will all know, is the University of Saint Andrews Sports Centre and some of you will recognise that this supplants the younger hall, which has been the conventional setting for our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929. The younger hall has been closed since July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that will revitalise that space for the next century of its existence and ensure that the entire building. Is fully accessible to all users. Our current utilization of the Sports Centre allows us to gather safely whilst observing public health guidance issued by the Scottish Government with which we have been in lockstep throughout the pandemic. Within those vehicle guidelines, all attendees are required to wear a face covering both when seated and when moving about the venue. That includes my colleagues on stage and our students as they collect their degrees. An exception applies for people with prerequisite exemptions and people speaking as part of the ceremony are permitted to remove face coverings for the duration of their remarks. I have to speak throughout the ceremony and so have removed my face covering for the duration. You are entitled, of course, to remove your covering upon leaving this indoor setting and moving outdoors. But we must ask that you replace them for the graduation reception this afternoon, at which if you attend you must wear a covering when inside the marquee, unless in the act of eating and drinking there is a professional photography studio set up here in the sports hall and those of you who choose to make use of that for for formal photos are welcome to. Remove your coverings. When the photographer asks you to say cheese. What these restrictions symbolise is the way that we have collectively adapted to overcome the challenges of our time, and I find our face coverings and our willingness to adopt them to be a reminder of how far we have come and of the respect and consideration that we, at Saint Andrews have shown to one another throughout the pandemic. The Sports Centre is a fitting reminder of that too. Sporting activities were prohibited during the first stretch of the pandemic, but our sports Centre and its over 50 clubs are once again operating at full capacity. This parallels the resumption of public life and activities more broadly and at Saint Andrews, both our students association and its over 130 societies and the brand brand new Laidlaw Music Centre are offering their full range of opportunities. Indeed, let us hope that these in person graduation ceremonies can be perceived as the denormal of the pandemic years marking. We hope our transition to a post pandemic world in which we will observe precautions where necessary, progress with kindness and respect and give thanks for the returning opportunities for which we do have now an elevated appreciation. The University of Saint Andrews is particularly renowned for the quality of this experiential offering in the National Student Survey, a UK wide collection of student feedback, Saint Andrews has placed first four student satisfaction for each of the past six years, including this one in which we were also the only university in the country to attain over 90% satisfaction. This success was paralleled by the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide for 2022, in which Saint Andrews was named the best university in the UK the first time in the history of this or any other domestic league table that an institution has placed first ahead of both Oxford and Cambridge. Those two attainments, the pandemic not withstanding, are a powerful testament to what we do here, the quality of our teaching, but also the supportiveness of our staff and the drive and ambition of our students. Our graduates will thus receive their degrees from Scotland and the UK's Premier University, as well as Scotland's oldest. Saint Andrews is the third oldest university in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest anywhere. The tradition of graduation which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. The first of these you have already witnessed as St Servatus Chapel Choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the Gaudi armours and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor. Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer as vice Chancellor. I preside over these ceremonies and I am invested with the authority to award degrees which will immediately follow this introduction. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition. I will call upon the Deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and I then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts and to symbolise this, I place upon you this cap. To most though, we simply say ET. Super Tay, meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or beraten touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in our ceremonies since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and I paused to reassure you that it has been regularly dry cleaned ever since. And it is used to symbolise the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of the place with a long lineage. Of Saint Andrews alumni. When the Conferrals are complete since of 80s, Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to our wonderful choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins, for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed to the induction of new university professors. To close our ceremony, it is tradition that the university invites a guest to address our new graduates, to inspire them and to wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives. Today's guest speaker is Doctor Karen Brown from the School of Art History. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession around the running track. Here in Saint Andrews, the teachers and staff who have supported you are graduations are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 608 years and who support one another in the present. So while you were graduating, you were not leaving our community. But taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience, and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life. Decanus faculty Artis arzum.

We will now turn to the induction of new professors and integral and important part of our graduation tradition. Academic institutions are highly organised ones and academic structures vary between countries, most notably between Europe and American models. At Saint Andrews, the first academic posting is conventionally electric ship, and lecturers become senior lecturers, then readers as they progress up the ladder, although it should be said that many academic careers are not quite so linear in practice. Professors are the most senior academics within our university and the sector more broadly, and appointment to the professoriate recognises careers of outstanding achievement, the pursuit of excellence, and the production of scholarship that has had a demonstrable impact in its field. It is a significant pinnacle in an academic career. Alongside the introduction in induction of new professors today, we will also mark the appointment of a Bishop Wardlaw professor. The title of Bishop Wardlaw professor is bestowed by the university court upon academics who have been elected as a fellow of one of the United Kingdoms. 2 leading learned societies, the British Academy for scholars in the Arts and Humanities and the Royal Society for Science and Medicine Scholars. Membership of either of these bodies is extremely prestigious and an honour attained only by the leading academics of our time. The title takes its name from the founder of our university, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, to recognise that those who carry it participate in a tradition of scholarly excellence established over 600 years ago. Prior to this graduation session, there have been just 21 Bishop Ward law professors at the university. Since the position was introduced in 1997. We thus recognise and formally induct our new professors and Bishop Ward law professors during these graduation ceremonies so that we can celebrate. I will call for the new professors and they will be inducted into the professoriate with prescribed Latin phrases. Each professor will then be given a book by me in recognition of their lifetime committed to the written word. Each professor has been invited to select a work of their choice, which is gifted to them by the university and presented out with this ceremony. The books they receive on stage today are symbolic of this transaction. The academics whom we recognise have taught and supported generations of students, including some of those who have just graduated whilst advancing their disciplines, promoting the transmission of ideas, generating discourse and changing our world as a consequence. Let us recognise their successes now. On the instruction of the Senatus Academicas, of which I declare this a fully constituted meeting, I shall now install its newly appointed professors.

Vice Chancellor, graduates, staff and guests warmest congratulations to all our new graduates. Their families and friends gathered here marking your graduation from the University of Saint Andrews. It's time to celebrate your achievements and enjoy this rite of passage experienced by fellow alumni for more than 600 years in this small but dramatic medieval town of Saint Andrews, I've learned on good authority that there are 35 different countries represented at a ceremony today, illustrating the point that Saint Andrews is a university that's in the words of Scottish. Polymath Sir Patrick Gettis can think global in reach and ambition, but act local in delivery of excellent teaching, learning and student experience. In the course of your studies, you required a whole range of skills that will now hold you in good stead for your future, but of course not all of these are academic during your time here, many of you have engaged in societies for sport, music, environmental justice, social diversity and other interests, leading to the enrichment of your lives and the development of friendships with the like minded people. Moreover, in studying during the COVID-19 restrictions you have shown your ability to adapt to unpredictable change. Consider together these are the skills that will be essential for the wider world that you are now embarking upon. As you leave these chilly shores of Fife this December to follow your hopes and dreams. My own hopes and dreams were created where I studied at Trinity College in Dublin, a community that still holds a very special special place in my heart for the friendships and memories made there ranging from discoveries in the archives to days in pubs spent with friends, talking about literature of theology, the arts or sneaking through front arch in the dark to return to the safe haven of rooms, escaping the noise and excitement of Dublin at night. I didn't know at that point that I would go on to becoming an academic living in Scotland specializing in community museums in Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean. But when I look back, I believe it's largely the values and beliefs that I learned at Trinity that honed my path. Thanks mainly to Turkey professors. I learned the values of being true to yourself of following your gut instincts and of having faith that life is unfolding as it should. Even when it doesn't work out as you expected. As WB Yates reflected when looking at portraits of Irish cultural leaders in the municipal gallery, my glory was I had such friends. These are also the qualities that I've recognized in the community. Museum leaders that I've had the privilege to work with in Latin America, and if I may, I'd like to take this occasion to share some wisdom learnt from one very special indigenous woman and elder from Costa Rica, who drove the creation of their community museum for over 30 years and who also rather amazingly came here to speak at the Byre Theatre as well as in Portree High School in the Isle of Skye. This wisdom is. To honour ancestral memories and to keep them alive. To have a clear vision that's of benefit for the collective good. To practice practice collective forms of decision making to have faith in a spiritual force that's greater than yourself. To be patient for you will get there slowly, little by little and finally to have fun and make time to celebrate with European unity. I suspect that I've tested your patients well enough by now. After this long ceremony, and you can't wait to go on and celebrate your own successes, but I would like to take one little moment to commend graduate Lioni leader, whom I had the privilege to supervise for attaining the Saunders Memorial Prize today for her thesis on indigenous cultural heritage and decolonisation. But to return to where we began today, today is a moment marking New Horizons for each of you at a time when you're likely to be experiencing a mixture of excitement and nervousness. I hope that following your well deserved festivities today and before you leave, you'll pause to take one more look out over the Vista of the North Sea and reflect upon what memories you may hold on to from our small university town. Memories that have made you who you are today through the hard times and the good values formed together with us, your teachers and support staff. As an academic community and change. So congratulations once again, all the very best for your futures and please stay in touch. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Or abuse. Gratia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas Day at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism. Amen."
