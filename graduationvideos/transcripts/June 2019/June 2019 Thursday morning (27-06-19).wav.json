cotinus sanctum nomen tuum glorificus it's misericordia to a vitam iterum consequent per year sum christum dominum nostrum amen please be seated i call upon the principle of the university good morning i am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony at this gathering which officially is a meeting of these sonatas academic years scholars become masters masters become doctors and people of distinction are honoured it is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation the ceremony marks a significant rite of passage in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before and that moment is shared by all of us here in the hall today saint andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation we are proud to be scotland 's first and most ancient university we are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for so i will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony at this point i would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate professor michael cook the largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the confirment of degrees at masters and doctoral level we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin in accordance with saint andrews tradition we call upon the deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and we then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say that superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or beratung touches the head of the graduate this particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the bricks or trousers of one of his university 's most famous sixteenth century students john knox the major proponent of the reformation in scotland and author amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women so i am quite relieved to tell you that researchers shown that this cap actually had different origins it was purchased for the doctoral graduation in sixteen ninety six of sir john arbuthnot the celebrated scottish physician and satirist his cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the seventeenth century as my colleagues and i processed into the younger hall today you will have noted that the academic procession was headed by the universities maces which now are placed just to the right of me and together form a collection unrivalled by any university in the world maces are effectively sceptres or staffs of office and thus are symbols of the academic authority of the university they are an immensely venerable part of academic tradition three of our maces are of particular antiquity and importance in fourteen sixteen three years after the foundation of the university the then dean of arts expended the princely sum of five pounds to commission a mace for the faculty of arts now in the middle of the stand to your left there were few buildings no library and scarce teaching materials so this investment in a mace communicates much of the power such objects hold the canon law mace which is in the middle to your right was produced in the mid fifteenth century most probably by a scottish goldsmith and with a view to challenging the preeminence of the arts faculty at the time the traditions of academic rivalry date back to our very foundation these two maces were complemented in fourteen sixty one by the saint salvatores mace which is the most elaborate and beautifully raught of the medieval maces today it's on your left closest to the chancellor it was commissioned by bishop james kennedy the founder of saint south atas our other maces have all been commissioned in the last seventy five years signifying that objects of this nature have continuing symbolic value allowing us to remain strongly in contact with our history as we add to it to return now to today's ceremony after students are awarded their degrees members of saint salvator 's chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate on professor cook followed by the graduation address which today will be delivered by professor bridget heel the ceremony will close with the benediction by the university chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession graduation is the highlight of the university year we are delighted that you're all here to share in the success of our graduates i hope this is a really memorable and happy day for all of

i called the front professor ali ansari of the school of history chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of letters honoris kauser professor michael cook michael cook is class of nineteen forty three university professor of near eastern studies at princeton university he is a scholar of international renown in the field of middle east history with a particular interest in the rise and development of islam his works include a number of seminal studies including commanding right and forbidding wrong in islamic thought which was subsequently translated into both persian and arabic and the provocative and highly influential hagarism on the origins of islam published with the late patricia corona his interests needless to say range more broadly into aspects of global and comparative history including an essay on the abbasid caliphate and the carolingian empire as well as a one volume history of the human race in twenty ten he oversaw as general editor the publication of the new cambridge history of islam michael allen cook began his academic career studying european history at the university of cambridge where in the best tradition of the noted british orientalist edward granville brown he took the liberty and opportunity to learn both persian and turkish he then pursued postgraduate research in the ottoman empire at the school of oriental and african studies in london where he secured his first post before departing these shores for a position at princeton university in nineteen eighty six in doing so michael will no doubt have been unaware of the deep links he was fortunate forging with scotland and the university of saint andrews princeton of course is well known as one of the leading universities in the united states less well known is the relationship it enjoys with this university not least in the person of the scottish presbyterian minister john witherspoon the sixth president of the then college of new jersey and one of the founding fathers of the united states but more importantly witherspoon was also a recipient of an honorary doctorate from this university in seventeen sixty four with more than fifty publications to his credit including nine books professor michael cook has devoted his life to exploring interrogating and above all explaining the richness of islamic history and civilisation to a wider public he has received numerous honors for his work including election to the american philosophical society the distinguished achievement award from the mellon foundation election to the american academy of arts and sciences along with the fellowship of the british academy he has received a favourable mention in the preface to the english edition of fernand braudel 's the mediterranean and the mediterranean world and the age of the second and last but by no means least an unfavourable mention in edward saeed 's cultural and imperialism chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to middle eastern and islamic history i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters on norris kauser on professor michael cook today i was glad to him told us that there are menorahs cows are from movio cougars ray in symbolum sulfate hopefully retirement ponum chancellor principle students parents staff when i learned that i could say a few words at first i was rather scared because i thought they would have to be in latin but once i had realized that i could speak in english i agreed and i'd like to tell you how excited i was when i learned that i was going to get it an honorary degree from this university and i immediately decided that i ought to know a bit more about this university than i did but being extremely old fashioned i didn't google saint andrews instead i went to rashdall 's three volume history of the medieval universities of europe and sure enough there you were somewhere towards the end of volume two and i very quickly picked up the fact that you'd been founded in fourteen thirteen which is splendid and that's well over three hundred years before princeton but as i read on as i read on i came across something that i found really rather disconcerting this happened round about fifteen forty you got advice from paris paris mind you not just anywhere advice from paris to establish the teaching of arabic at this university and i'm very sorry to have to tell you that your bureaucrats immediately rejected the idea and i'm this really bothered me and i talked to a few people about it and some of them said look five hundred years have passed let bygones be bygones others said look in the meantime saint andrews has it more than made up for that they've established a stellar program teaching arabic and what's more they've thrown in persian but the best argument was one given to me by my wife kim who is somewhere in this whole she pointed out to me that saint andrews has recently been placed second in the pecking order of british universities right ahead of oxford ahead of oxford and just behind cambridge and i can see that that is not in the least displeasing to you and it also suited me down to the ground because i was always brought up to think of oxford as the kind of outfit that can't win a boat race without the clandestine use of an outboard motor but as cambridge as you know from what ali said is my alma mater and i do appreciate your tact in not bumping cambridge from the top position right that's enough about me let me now take this opportunity to congratulate everybody in this whole who has just been awarded a non honorary degree those are the kind of degrees that are directly and simply correlated with effort and talent of course the time may come when you're in line for an honorary degree but in the meantime you have your lives ahead of you and i wish you all the good luck in the world in the trials tribulations and triumphs that lie ahead of you let me also just say a word to parents parents congratulations on the success of your sons and daughters i know very well that getting them to this point has meant a tremendous amount of hassle over the last twenty years or so but i think today is the day when you can look back on those years and say yes it was worth it after all thank you brother i call upon professor bridget hill of the school of history chancellor 's principal ladies gentlemen everyone new graduates well done you've made it on behalf of all my colleagues it's my great pleasure to congratulate you on your achievement and to offer you good wishes for the future and congratulations to all those who've supported you along the way family friends and the many people who've worked to make the various parts of this university run smoothly during your time here most of you are about to leave the bubble to step into a different world so in preparing this address i turned to my former students and asked them for their favorite saint andrews memories what did they take away with them from their years spent here strangely given that they were writing to me none of them even mentioned studying history their colleagues behind me on the stage will be glad to hear they said very nice things about our teaching instead they said medip chinti ice cream from ginettas for breakfast and seagulls the size of albatrosses many of them not surprisingly mentioned the astonishing natural beauty of this part of the world all too easy to forget when your days are spent rushing from lectures to classes to the library or during the dark days of december they mentioned the beaches especially on long summer days like today above all they remembered fondly the close knit community and the many lasting friendships and a few marriages forged during their time here my former students also mentioned saint andrews itself the very special experience of studying history or art history in a place itself steeped in history in the sixteenth century saint andrews was described by the general assembly of the church of scotland as the most flourishing city at a divine and human learning in all of scotland the university has not flourished nonstop since then there was certainly a bit of a wobble around the eighteenth century but throughout its long history it's made a profound contribution to the intellectual and cultural life of scotland and of the wider world you should all be very proud to be part of that history so it was a great achievement to get here and it's a great achievement to have graduated what else do i hope you might take away with you other than a degree certificate and memories of ice cream and enormous seagulls independence and self motivation resourcefulness and an ability to manage your time and to balance work with other commitments and i'd highlight in particular the highly transferable skill of getting yourself to class for a nine AM start i hope that you leave saint andrews with an open and inquiring mind with a sense of curiosity and with a continuing desire for knowledge as a historian or an art historian i hope that you take out into the wider world and ability to read and to look critically to analyze to argue clearly and to reject simplistic explanations for change both in the past and in the present i hope that you take with your compassion and ability to engage with unfamiliar belief systems and a vision of the world that goes beyond national and linguistic borders graduation is the end of something significant but also the beginning of something even more important we're sending you out well equipped into a turbulence world in a society and culture shaped for better or worse by the internet by twenty four hour news cycle and by social media the skills that you've worked so hard to acquire here are needed more than ever one of my students wrote after reminiscing about her time here i'd better stop now before i buy a one way train ticket back know that you're always welcome back know that one of the things that gives us great pleasure as teachers is to hear from our former students and to learn what you have gone on to do and know also that yes we will respond to your requests for employers references even years into the future but before you think too hard about the future enjoy the present go out and celebrate congratulations please stand for the benediction garanzia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular forum army",

course is well known as one of the leading universities in the united states less well known is the relationship it enjoys with this university not least in the person of the scottish presbyterian minister john witherspoon the 6th president of the then college of new jersey and one of the founding fathers of the united states but more importantly witherspoon was also a recipient of an honorary

i was when i learned that i was going to get it an honorary degree from this university and i immediately decided that i ought to know a bit more about this university than i did but being extremely old fashioned i didn't google saint andrews instead i went to rashdall's three volume history of the medieval universities of europe and sure enough there you were somewhere towards the end of volume 2 and i very quickly picked up the fact that you'd been founded in 1413 which is splendid and that's well over 300 years before princeton but as i read on as i read on i came across something that i found really rather disconcerting this happened round about 1540 you got advice from paris paris mind you not just anywhere advice from paris to establish the teaching of arabic at this university and i'm very sorry to have to tell you that your bureaucrats immediately rejected the idea and i'm this really bothered me and i talked to a few people about it and some of them said look 500 years have passed let bygones be bygones others said look in the meantime st andrews has it more than made up for that they've established a stellar program teaching arabic and what's more they've thrown in persian but the best argument was one given to me by my wife kim who is somewhere in this whole she pointed out to me that saint andrews has recently been placed second in the pecking order of british universities right ahead of oxford ahead of oxford and just behind cambridge and i can see that that is not in the least displeasing to you and it also suited me down to the ground because i was always brought up to think of oxford as the kind of outfit that can't win a boat race without the clandestine use of an outboard motor but as cambridge as you know from what ali said is my alma mater and i do appreciate your tact in not bumping cambridge from the top position right that's enough about me let me now take this opportunity to congratulate everybody in this whole who has just been awarded a non honorary degree those are the kind of degrees that are directly and simply correlated with effort and talent of course the time may come when you're in line for an honorary degree but in the meantime you have your lives ahead of you and i wish you all the good luck in the world in the trials tribulations and triumphs that lie ahead of you let me also just say a word to parents parents congratulations on the success of your sons and daughters i know very well that getting them to this point has meant a tremendous amount of hassle over the last 20 years or so but i think today is the

you are about to leave the bubble to step into a different world so in preparing this address i turned to my former students and asked them for their favorite saint andrews memories what did they take away with them from their years spent here strangely given that they were writing to me none of them even mentioned studying history their colleagues behind me on the stage will be glad to hear they said very nice things about our teaching instead they said medip chinti ice cream from ginettas for breakfast and seagulls the size of albatrosses many of them not surprisingly mentioned the

the beaches especially on long summer days like today above all they remembered fondly the close knit community and the many lasting friendships and a few marriages forged during their time here my former students also mentioned saint andrews itself the very special experience of studying history or art history in a place itself steeped in history in the 16th century st andrews was described by the general assembly of the church of scotland as the most flourishing city at a divine and human learning in all of scotland the university has not flourished nonstop since then there was certainly a bit of a wobble around the 18th century but throughout its long history it's made a profound contribution to the intellectual and cultural life of scotland and of the wider world you should all be very proud to be part of that history so it was a great achievement to get here and it's a great achievement to have graduated what else do i hope you might take away with you other than a degree certificate and memories of ice cream and enormous seagulls independence and self motivation resourcefulness and an ability to manage your time and to balance work with other commitments and i'd highlight in particular the highly transferable skill of getting yourself to class for a 9:00 AM start i hope that you leave saint andrews with an open and inquiring mind with a sense of curiosity and

In a few moments, the academic procession will enter the hall to welcome the academic procession. Members of since Avatars Chapel Choir will lead us in singing the Gaudeamus, please do join in. The words can be found in your program. At the end of the graduation ceremony, all our new graduates will join the academic procession, leaving the younger hall and walking along North Street and entering St Salvatore's quadrangle through the Archway. To other supporters here, Please wait until all our new graduates have left the hall. Ushers will then ensure you to the nearest exit outside. You will be directed to the quad where you will be able to join our new graduates. Please ensure that your mobile phone is switched off. And please remain seated throughout the ceremony. And even when you're taking photographs or recordings, please remain in your seat now to capture this unique moment. Our official photographer will be taking a photograph now of those graduating today before the ceremony begins. Good morning. What glorious day? Let me see. A glorious smiles there. You like it, we're ready, here we go. Yeah. Wonderful thank you, thank you. Thank you very much for your attention. I hope you enjoy the graduation ceremony. Please rise for the Gaudeamus.

Arte and Capiat ET Perte equipped Tum Finnia tour. Cotinus sanctum nomen tuum, glorificus. It's misericordia to a vitam iterum consequent. Per year sum christum dominum nostrum. Amen. Please be seated. I call upon the principle of the university. Good morning, I am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony. At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of these sonatas, academic years scholars become masters, masters become doctors and people of distinction are honoured. It is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation. The ceremony marks a significant rite of passage, in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before, and that moment is shared by all of us. Here in the hall today. Saint Andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking. Important in all of this is that as we change, we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. At this point I would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate Professor Michael Cook. The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the confirment of degrees at Masters and doctoral level. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin, in accordance with Saint Andrews tradition, we call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though we simply say. That superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or beratung touches the head of the graduate. This particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the bricks or trousers of one of his university's most famous 16th century students, John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and author, amongst other things, of the first blast of the trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women. So I am quite relieved to tell you that researchers shown that this CAP actually had different origins. It was purchased for the doctoral graduation in 1696 of Sir John Arbuthnot, the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. His cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century. As my colleagues and I processed into the younger hall today, you will have noted that the academic procession was headed by the universities maces, which now are placed just to the right of me and together form a collection unrivalled by any university in the world. Maces are effectively sceptres or Staffs of office, and thus are symbols of the academic authority of the university. They are an immensely venerable. Part of academic tradition. Three of our maces are of particular antiquity and importance in 1416, three years after the foundation of the university, the then Dean of Arts expended the princely sum of £5 to Commission a Mace for the Faculty of Arts. Now in the middle of the stand to your left. There were few buildings, no library and scarce teaching materials, so this investment in a Mace communicates much of the power such objects hold. The Canon law Mace, which is in the middle to your right, was produced in the mid 15th century, most probably by a Scottish Goldsmith, and with a view to challenging the preeminence of the arts faculty at the time. The traditions of academic rivalry date back to our very foundation. These two maces were complemented in 1461 by the Saint Salvatores Mace, which is the most elaborate and beautifully raught of the medieval maces. Today it's on your left closest to the chancellor. It was commissioned by Bishop James Kennedy, the founder of St South Atas. Our other maces have all been commissioned in the last 75 years, signifying that objects of this nature have continuing symbolic value, allowing us to remain strongly in contact with our history as we add to it. To return now to today's ceremony. After students are awarded their degrees, members of Saint Salvator's Chapel Choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate on Professor Cook, followed by the graduation address, which today will be delivered by Professor Bridget Heel. The ceremony will close with the benediction by the University chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We are delighted that you're all here to share in the success of our graduates. I hope this is a really memorable and happy day for all of you. Decanters, freckled Tartus altium.

I called the front professor Ali Ansari of the School of History. Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris Kauser, Professor Michael Cook. Michael Cook is class of 1943 university professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University. He is a scholar of international renown in the field of Middle East history with a particular interest in the rise and development of Islam. His works. Include a number of seminal studies including commanding right and forbidding wrong in Islamic thought, which was subsequently translated into both Persian and Arabic and the provocative and highly influential hagarism on the origins of Islam. Published with the late Patricia Corona. His interests, Needless to say, range more broadly into aspects of global and comparative history, including an essay on the Abbasid Caliphate and the Carolingian Empire, as well as a one volume history of the human race. In 2010 he oversaw as general editor the publication of the New Cambridge History of Islam. Michael Allen Cook began his academic career studying European history at the University of Cambridge where in the best tradition of the noted British orientalist Edward Granville Brown. He took the Liberty and opportunity to learn both Persian and Turkish. He then pursued postgraduate research in the Ottoman Empire at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, where he secured his first post before departing these shores for a position at Princeton University in 1986. In doing so, Michael will no doubt have been unaware of the deep links. He was fortunate forging with Scotland and the University of Saint Andrews. Princeton, of course, is well known as one of the leading universities in the United States. Less well known is the relationship it enjoys with this university, not least in the person of the Scottish Presbyterian Minister John Witherspoon, the 6th president of the then College of New Jersey and one of the founding fathers of the United States. But more importantly, Witherspoon was also a recipient of an honorary doctorate from this university in 1764. With more than 50 publications to his credit, including nine books, Professor Michael Cook has devoted his life to exploring, interrogating, and above all, explaining the richness of Islamic history and civilisation to a wider public. He has received numerous honors for his work, including election to the American Philosophical Society, the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Mellon Foundation, election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, along with the Fellowship of the British Academy. He has received a favourable mention in the preface to the English edition of Fernand Braudel's, the Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world and the age of the second and last, but by no means least an unfavourable mention in Edward Saeed's cultural and imperialism. Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to Middle Eastern and Islamic history, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters on Norris Kauser on Professor Michael Cook. Today I was glad to him, told us that there are menorahs. Cows are from movio Cougars ray in symbolum sulfate. Hopefully retirement ponum. Chancellor. Principle students. Parents. Staff. When I learned that I could say a few words. At first I was rather scared because I thought they would have to be in Latin. But once I had realized that I could speak in English, I agreed. And I'd like to tell you how excited I was when I learned that I was going to get it an honorary degree. From this university. And I immediately decided that I ought to know a bit more about this university than I did. But being extremely old fashioned, I didn't Google Saint Andrews. Instead, I went to rashdall's three volume history of the medieval universities of Europe. And sure enough, there you were somewhere towards the end of volume 2. And I very quickly picked up the fact that you'd been founded in 1413, which is splendid, and that's well over 300 years before Princeton. But as I read on as I read on, I came across something that I found really rather disconcerting. This happened round about 1540. You got advice from Paris, Paris, mind you, not just anywhere advice from Paris to establish the teaching of Arabic at this university. And I'm very sorry to have to tell you that your bureaucrats immediately rejected the idea. And I'm this really bothered me and I talked to a few people about it and some of them said look 500 years have passed. Let bygones be bygones. Others said look in the meantime. St. Andrews has it more than made up for that. They've established a stellar program teaching Arabic and what's more, they've thrown in Persian. But the best argument was one given to me by my wife Kim, who is somewhere in this whole. She pointed out to me that Saint Andrews has recently been placed second in the pecking order of British universities. Right ahead of Oxford, ahead of Oxford and just behind Cambridge. And I can see that that is not in the least displeasing to you, and it also suited me down to the ground because I was always brought up to think of Oxford as the kind of outfit that can't win a boat race without the clandestine use of an outboard motor. But as Cambridge, as you know from what Ali said, is my alma mater and I do appreciate your tact in not bumping Cambridge from the top position. Right, that's enough about me. Let me now take this opportunity to congratulate everybody in this whole who has just been awarded a non honorary degree. Those are the kind of degrees that are directly and simply correlated with effort and talent. Of course, the time may come when you're in line for an honorary degree, but in the meantime you have your lives ahead of you, and I wish you all the good luck in the world in the trials, tribulations, and triumphs that lie ahead of you. Let me also just say a word to parents. Parents, congratulations on the success of your sons and daughters. I know very well that getting them to this point has meant a tremendous amount of hassle over the last 20 years or so. But I think today is the day when you can look back on those years and say, yes, it was worth it. After all. Thank you, brother. I call upon Professor Bridget Hill of the School of History. Chancellor's principal, ladies, gentlemen, everyone. New graduates well done. You've made it on behalf of all my colleagues. It's my great pleasure to congratulate you on your achievement and to offer you good wishes for the future. And congratulations to all those who've supported you along the way. Family, friends and the many people who've worked to make the various parts of this university run smoothly during your time here. Most of you are about to leave the bubble to step into a different world. So in preparing this address I turned to my former students and asked them for their favorite Saint Andrews memories. What did they take away with them from their years spent here? Strangely, given that they were writing to me, none of them even mentioned studying history. Their colleagues behind me on the stage will be glad to hear they said very nice things about our teaching. Instead, they said, Medip chinti ice cream from ginettas for breakfast and seagulls the size of albatrosses. Many of them, not surprisingly mentioned the astonishing natural beauty of this part of the world. All too easy to forget when your days are spent rushing from lectures to classes, to the library, or during the dark days of December. They mentioned the beaches, especially on long summer days like today above. All, they remembered fondly the close knit community and the many lasting friendships and a few marriages forged during their time here. My former students also mentioned Saint Andrews itself. The very special experience of studying history or art history in a place itself steeped in history. In the 16th century, St. Andrews was described by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland as the most flourishing city at a divine and human learning in all of Scotland. The university has not flourished nonstop since then. There was certainly a bit of a wobble around the 18th century, but throughout its long history it's made a profound contribution to the intellectual and cultural life of Scotland and of the wider world. You should all be very proud to be part of that history. So it was a great achievement to get here, and it's a great achievement to have graduated. What else do I hope you might take away with you other than a degree, certificate and memories of ice cream and enormous seagulls? Independence and self motivation, resourcefulness, and an ability to manage your time and to balance work with other commitments. And I'd highlight in particular the highly transferable skill of getting yourself to class for a 9:00 AM start. I hope that you leave Saint Andrews with an open and inquiring mind with a sense of curiosity and with a continuing desire for knowledge as a historian or an art historian, I hope that you take out into the wider world and ability to read and to look critically to analyze, to argue clearly and to reject simplistic explanations for change both in the past and in the present. I hope that you take with your compassion and ability to engage with unfamiliar belief systems and a vision of the world that goes beyond national and linguistic borders. Graduation is the end of something significant, but also the beginning of something even more important. We're sending you out well equipped into a turbulence world. In a society and culture shaped for better or worse by the Internet by 24 hour news cycle and by social media, the skills that you've worked so hard to acquire here are needed more than ever. One of my students wrote after reminiscing about her time here. I'd better stop now before I buy a one way train ticket back. Know that you're always welcome back. Know that one of the things that gives us great pleasure as teachers is to hear from our former students and to learn what you have gone on to do and know also that yes, we will respond to your requests for employers references even years into the future. But before you think too hard about the future, enjoy the present. Go out and celebrate. Congratulations. Please stand for the benediction. Garanzia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi, at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular forum army."
