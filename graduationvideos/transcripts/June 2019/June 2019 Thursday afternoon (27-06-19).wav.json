sanctum nomen tuum glorificus it misericordia tua vitam itanium consequence or per yessum christum dominum nostrum amen please be seated i call upon the principle of the university good afternoon i am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony at this gathering which officially is a meeting of the sonatas academicals scholars become masters masters become doctors and people of distinction are honored it is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation the ceremony marks a significant rite of passage in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation become something that they were not before and that moment is shared by everyone here in the hall today saint andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation we are proud to be scotland 's first and most ancient university we are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for so i will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony at this point i would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate professor jim al khalili the largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the confirment of degrees of masters and doctoral level we convert degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin in accordance with saint andrews tradition we call upon the deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and we then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduate this particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the breaks or trousers of one of this university 's most famous sixteenth century students john knox the major proponent of the reformation in scotland and also amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women so i'm quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had different origins and was purchased for the doctoral graduation in sixteen ninety six of sir john arbuthnot the celebrated scottish physician and satirist his cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the seventeenth century so as you as you have heard the university of saint andrews is scotland 's oldest university as well as its best university while authority to grant degrees was awarded to the university in fourteen thirteen we have not always had a building so worthy of this spectacle as the younger hall where we are today graduation for many years took place in the old university library on south street as the university drew towards its quincentenary which was celebrated in nineteen eleven it became apparent that we lacked a building of sufficient scale for that and other such occasions the solution at the time of the quincentenary was an enormous marquee a habit which you will see later today we have not wholly abandoned however it was felt that a building more fitting the solemnity and magnificence of the university was required and in nineteen nineteen doctor james and mrs annie younger of the noted brewing family who lived in nearby mount melville made a donation that allowed the university to plan for this handsome building building work commenced in nineteen twenty three during james irvins principalship in overseeing the construction of the hall principal ervin deliberately ensured that it was set back thirty feet from the frontage of north street so that it does not intrude upon the long vista looking towards the cathedral it is out that a building planned for the future of saint andrews is respectful to its past the younger hall was opened by the duchess of york later queen elizabeth the queen mother in nineteen twenty nine the intention behind this building has a further significance james and annie younger asked that it be a facility open to the town of saint andrews as well as the university and we are proud that that dual focus is still honoured the ground floor is sprung for scottish country dancing and both university and townspeople have been known to enjoy a dashing white sergeant on its well worn timbers saint andrews is a place that gains its strength from its capacity to bring people together from across the town and across the globe and the younger hall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time we reopen the hall after completing a project to refit and refresh this cherished building so to return now to today's ceremony after students are awarded their degrees members of saint salvator 's chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate on professor al khalili followed by the graduation address which today will be delivered by professor jason kernig the ceremony will close with the benediction by the university chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession graduation is the highlight of the university year we are delighted that you are here to share in the success of our graduates i hope that this is a memorable and most happy day for all of you the kanus faculty oasis altium chancellor i have the

for education in the science faculty doctor jonathan isbella chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science honoris causa professor jim al khalili professor alka lilly OBE or jim as he is affectionately known by many moved to the UK from baghdad aged sixteen took his a levels and was accepted to the university of surrey in nineteen eighty two when he graduated with a first class degree in physics he went on to further study and in nineteen eighty nine was awarded his PHD in physics for a thesis entitled intermediate energy deuteron elastic scattering from nuclei in a three body model after his PHD after his PHD he moved to UCLA for two years as a postdoctoral fellow and during this time there he published a number of papers including one on the few body globber model that would later be instrumental in his highly respected work on nutrient neutron halos in nineteen ninety two he returned to the university of surrey as a lecturer and over the next few years steadily gained a reputation within the field of theoretical nuclear physics and became a fellow of the institute of physics during this period you're also became known as a science communicator and published his first popular science book black holes wormholes and time machines by nineteen ninety nine jim had established himself as a world leading figure in the field of nuclear reaction theory with two papers which redefined the size of the neutron halo exceeding five hundred citations this important breakthrough work enabled him to communicate with audiences all around the world as an invited speaker at the major international conferences of that time in two thousand and five he was awarded both a personal chair in physics at the university of surrey and simultaneously the first university of surrey chair in public engagement in science at this point one might assume that he could relax and focus on his newly emerging media career however he continued with his passion for physics and in two thousand and seven was the youngest ever recipient of the royal society michael faraday medal and prize in two thousand eleven jim was awarded the institute of physics kelvin medal and prize and in two thousand eighteen he was elected to become a fellow of the royal society as well as becoming president of the british science association jim has more recently begun exploring new applications of quantum mechanics he's currently leading five PHD project examining quantum tunnelling by biological molecules and how this might link to genetic mutations so it seems that jimmy is rather good at nuclear physics but there's already mentioned he has more than one facet to his nature and alongside his academic research he's also been prolifically communicating his understanding and passion for science to us all his long standing role as the presenter of BBC radio four 's the life scientific is for many people his best known body of work the series in which every episode is dedicated to exploring the biography of a different and currently working scientist is enormously popular it's been running since two thousand and eleven and it regularly draws an audience of over two million listeners per episode and was recognised by the broadcasting industry in two thousand and thirteen with a prestigious VLV or voice of the listener and viewer award for excellence jim is also a prolific writer and has so far authored fourteen books covering various aspects of science and its cultural history history this body of work has been translated now into over twenty five languages and has amassed sales in the UK of over two hundred thousand copies in addition to this last month for the release of his first novel a science fiction thriller entitled sunfall which has already received excellent early reviews from the likes of stephen baxter one of the united kingdom 's most widely respected science fiction authors since the late nineteen nineties jim has established himself as one of the world 's best known science broadcasters presenting over forty hours of television programmes including two horizon documentaries and numerous multi episode history of science pieces which are used in teaching around the globe for his television work jim has received three grierson trust nominations one bafta nomination and awarded the international science film festival of athens prize for a science documentary but for professor alkali one of the most highly regarded recognitions he has received is the one that links his academic and media careers in twenty sixteen he was awarded by professor stephen hawking the inaugural stephen hawking medal of science communication professor jim arculli is a scientist a humanist a prolific author and acclaimed broadcaster and historian a teacher who incidentally has not taken a sabbatical from teaching in over twenty years and without doubt is a true polymath chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to theoretical nuclear physics and for his work in the public engagement of science i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science or norris kalsa on professor jim al khalili tell your grandma doctora scantier ignores kaiser from ohio symbolum sulphate hobby retirement pono solutions well thank you very much john that wasn't really cringeworthy standing there listening to listening to that chancellor 's principal graduates guests i feel immensely proud to receive this honorary degree from saint andrews as i'm sure you're all very well aware and and we we heard earlier that saint saint andrews is of course the oldest university in scotland the third oldest in the united kingdom while in contrast with the over six hundred year history of saint andrews my institution the university of surrey is still a baby only half a century old in fact i have been now at surrey for two thirds of its life i don't think anyone can say that about saint andrews just just i don't think so not quite anyway this morning i had the pleasure of delivering a general colloquium to the physics and astronomy school here where i talked about my current research area in the emerging and exciting field of quantum biology i don't blame you if you haven't heard of it which brings together theoretical physicists like me quantum chemists biochemists biophysicists spectroscopist nanotechnologists computer scientists and so on and in fact it's indicative of what we are seeing a lot in research in in science and indeed beyond science today it's becoming very much interdisciplinary in nature indeed here at saint andrews you have unquestionably one of the leading physics and astronomy departments in the in the UK in fact i note only a few days ago in the guardian i'm sure you will know of course in the guardian league tables saint andrews is number two now in in the UK and and of course the school of physics and astronomy is the top ranked physics and astronomy department in the country so there is much to be excited about in your research from condensed matter to photonics to exoplanets i've been very lucky in my career i spent the past two decades dividing my time roughly equally between the traditional academic duties in in in teaching and research on the one hand and public engagement activities on the other broadcasting public speaking writing earlier in my career as a full-time research physicist i followed the traditional academic route focusing on getting research funding applying for fellowships applying for grants in the hope of securing a permanent position the holy grail of any young academic but once i received my permanent position i became slightly restless yes i enjoyed the research more than anything else but i found the notion that we can learn what we can about some aspect of nature often after months or even years of research usually funded by public taxes and then publishing that work in a peer reviewed journal which is read by just a handful of other experts in the field before moving on to the next project in a continuing publish or perish cycle i found all this rather strange what's the point of learning something new about the way the world works if we don't then do something with it or at least tell the world about it and by that i don't just mean the other experts in one 's discipline but wider society too so i've been very gratified to see in recent years that communicating science to the public has become not only a respectable enterprise taken up by many active scientists but also acknowledged as an important responsibility today i'd argue that the UK leads the world in science communication public engagement or science by probably more than a decade in in whether this is through broadcasting writing social media blogs podcasts public forums like science festivals that springing up all around the country to the extent that sometimes i i dare to to wonder where the CP snows two cultures maybe are getting closer together and and it's been quite wonderful to be given an honorary degree here amongst so many graduates from the arts we may not always speak exactly the same language but it's i find that certainly some of the most exciting discoveries in science today whether it's in astronomy or particle physics genetics medicine innovations in engineering technology these are now becoming part of the general conversation alongside the arts politics and sport but there's also another more urgent need to communicate we live in a world facing monumental challenges in healthcare in rapid technological advances particularly in AI and and robotics and automation and in the wider environment particularly when it comes to the global climate crisis it's clear that scientists can no longer afford to remain quiet when populist movements try to shout down the forces of reason and rationalism with uninformed opinion and an irrational denial of scientific evidence i believe that this it's the responsibility and duty of those of us public scientists not just to pat ourselves on the back for our latest media success but to use our public platforms to argue for the importance of rational inquiry to push back against the insidious spread of self congratulatory ignorance and to fight for evidence based politics and policies and the importance of a scientifically literate population days like today are wonderful occasions for everyone the university staff the families of the students and most importantly of course the graduates themselves i was going to say graduates but i now appreciate you are now officially graduates you've spent the last few years here working hard and you're now ready to head off into the wider world to put your knowledge to work so today really is a day to cherish and remember and it's it's it it is touching sitting in the front row watching you come up on stage some of you more open in your celebratory smiles others rather more nervous making sure you just don't trip up being that the important thing to focus on so on behalf of all the but the the graduates the i would like and myself of course i would like to thank the university of saint andrews for this honour it has been wonderful and it's now wonderful to say that i have a real association through this degree with the university of such pedigree tradition and international reputation thank you very much you may need the proof you've got a degree i call them upon professor jason kernig of the school of classics chancellor ladies and gentlemen everyone first congratulations this is a special day these are special moments in life when we get the chance to step back from everything and look back on what we have achieved there will have been times in your degree when day to day life felt like anything but a triumph times when you struggled when you had found it hard to see everything in perspective but today you can celebrate all you have accomplished through those months and years of hard work the same goes for the family and friends who've been with you along the way this is a special day for them too but this is also in a sense just the beginning what matters in education is always what comes next the way we use what we have learned in the present and the future that's one of the things we can learn from ancient greek and roman culture i spent a lot of time in my research thinking about ancient education there are some spectacularly inappropriate models ancient education could be startlingly elitist aimed primarily at young men from wealthy families in some contexts we also find an unhealthy obsession with individual teachers as authority figures the art of libanius writes in his autobiography about going to study in athens in the fourth century CE there's no such thing as a university in the modern sense in the late antique mediterranean some big cities did have impressive concentrations of well known philosophers and orators libanius had come to study with one particular teacher he described as being kidnapped and imprisoned imprisoned by the followers of one of the other professors until he agrees to change his allegiances i would think that's attempting model for freshers week no need to no need to waste all that time advising you into the right modules there are other facets of ancient education that i think still have the capacity to set a very powerful example i think that applies especially to the principle we find in a lot of ancient philosophical writing which tells us that the value of education comes from the way in which individual students and teachers respond to it in their own minds and in their own lives education is a starting point for further exploration one of the most famous ancient expressions of that comes from a work by the philosopher plutarch from a work entitled on listening for the mind he says does not require filling like a bottle but rather like wood it only requires kindling to create in it and impulse to think independently and an urgent desire for the truth he uses much less flattering imagery for bad listeners in one passage he compares them with unfledged nestlings always gaping towards the mouth of another and wanting to receive everything already prepared and predigested for plutarch listening well involves responding creatively and actively to the ideas you encounter those images and others like them have had a vast postclassical afterlife of misquotation and misattribution they've also turned into cliches i was reminded of that recently in rereading PG woodhouse 's nineteen thirty four novel write home jeeves that contains one of the most disastrous and funniest of all graduation speeches in modern fiction that is the prize giving speech given by gussie fink nottle at the market snozzberry grammar school in day-to-day life he's a timid teetotaler he's terrified by the prospect of speaking in the hours before the ceremony he drinks some whiskey to give him courage and then some orange juice mixed with gin without realizing what it is the result is a comic rhetorical masterpiece he ends up insulting their headmaster along with there's people in the audience and the accused is one of the boys he's presenting a prize to of cheating in the scripture knowledge prize competition i was watching my orange juice at lunch today very carefully what i'm particularly interested in for now is a tiny moment in the previous chapter where jeeves is giving an account of his last minute advice to the speaker this is what he says i ventured to suggest that he might mention to the young gentlemen that education is a drawing out not a putting in the late lord brancaster was much addicted to presenting prizes at schools and he invariably employed this dictum that is a variant of the sentiment from plutarch especially the image they both reject which sees education as a process of filling a container the motto jeeves recommends is presented as a very conventional sentiment it's what a sober speaker ought to say on this kind of occasion presumably it's meant to seem proper but rather dull and i'm very much aware of that risk here i'm offering you a cliche a traditional platitude but for me what we get by looking back at ancient writing on education is a chance to recapture something of the freshness and power of that principle in its original context i think you can see that in the extraordinary range of imagery plutarch uses in another passage he tells us that good listeners should be like bees working together as a community but also individually transforming what they gather into honey when they have got something useful he says they fly away and get to work on it themselves of course it's important to celebrate today to look back on your education as something completed but it's also important not to put it in a box and not to assume that this is the end the education you've been through in saint andrews is something ongoing it's a starting point for all the explorations and adventures that lie ahead of you good luck thank you for all you've contributed in your time here congratulations again enjoy your day please stand for the benediction garanzia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti said kumar omnibus nobis in secular secular orum

town and across the globe and the younger hall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time we reopen the hall after completing a project to refit and refresh this cherished building so to return now to today's ceremony after students are awarded their degrees members of saint salvator's chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate on professor al khalili followed by the graduation address which today will be delivered by professor jason kernig the ceremony will close with the benediction by the university chaplain and

this i i think it's called a reprise i call upon the associate dean for education in the science faculty dr jonathan isbella chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science honoris causa professor jim al khalili professor alka lilly OBE or jim as he is affectionately known by many moved to the UK from baghdad aged 16 took his a levels and was accepted to the university of surrey in 1982 when he graduated with a first class degree in physics he went on to further study and in 1989 was awarded his PHD in physics for a thesis entitled intermediate energy deuteron elastic scattering from nuclei in A3 body model after his PHD after his PHD he moved to UCLA for two years as a postdoctoral fellow and during this time there he published a number of papers including one on the few body globber model that would later be instrumental in his highly respected work on nutrient neutron halos in 1992 he returned to the university of surrey as a lecturer and over the next few years steadily gained a reputation within the field of theoretical nuclear physics and became a fellow of the institute of physics during this period you're also became known as a science communicator and published his first popular science book black holes wormholes and time machines by 1999 jim had established himself as a world leading figure in the field of nuclear reaction theory with two papers which redefined the size of the neutron halo exceeding 500 citations this important breakthrough work enabled him to communicate with audiences all around the world as an invited speaker at the major international conferences of that time in 2005 he was awarded both a personal chair in physics at the university of surrey and simultaneously the first university of surrey chair in public engagement in science at this point one might assume that he could relax and focus on his newly emerging media career however he continued with his passion for physics and in 2007 was the youngest ever recipient of the royal society michael faraday medal and prize in 2011 jim was awarded the institute of physics kelvin medal and prize and in 2018 he was elected to become a fellow of the royal society as well as becoming president of the british science association jim has more recently begun exploring new applications of quantum mechanics he's currently leading 5 PHD project examining quantum tunnelling by biological molecules and how this might link to genetic mutations so it seems that jimmy is rather good at nuclear physics but there's already mentioned he has more than one facet to his nature and alongside his academic research he's also been prolifically communicating his understanding and passion for science to us all his long standing role as the presenter of BBC radio 4's the life scientific is for many people his best known body of work the series in which every episode is dedicated to exploring the biography of a different and currently working scientist is enormously popular it's been running since 2011 and it regularly draws an audience of over 2,000,000 listeners per episode and was recognised by the broadcasting industry in 2013 with a prestigious VLV or voice of the listener and viewer award for excellence jim is also a prolific writer and has so far authored 14 books covering various aspects of science and its cultural history history this body of work has been translated now into over 25 languages and has amassed sales in the UK of over 200,000 copies in addition to this last month for the release of his first novel a science fiction thriller entitled sunfall which has already received excellent early reviews from the likes of stephen baxter one of the united kingdom's most widely respected science fiction authors since the late 1990s jim has established himself as one of the world's best known science broadcasters presenting over 40 hours of television programmes including two horizon documentaries and numerous multi episode history of science pieces which are used in teaching around the globe for his television work jim has received 3 grierson trust nominations one bafta nomination and awarded the international science film festival of athens prize for a science documentary but for professor alkali one of the most highly regarded recognitions he has received is the one that links his academic and media careers in 2016 he was awarded by professor stephen hawking the inaugural stephen hawking medal of science communication professor jim arculli is a scientist a humanist a prolific author and acclaimed broadcaster and historian a teacher who incidentally has not taken a sabbatical from teaching in over 20 years and without doubt is a true polymath chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to theoretical nuclear physics and for his work in the public engagement of science i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science or norris kalsa on professor jim al khalili tell your grandma doctora scantier ignores kaiser from ohio symbolum sulphate hobby retirement pono solutions well thank you very much john that wasn't really cringeworthy standing there listening to listening to that chancellor's principal graduates guests i feel immensely proud to receive this honorary degree from saint andrews as i'm sure you're all very well aware and and we we heard earlier that st saint andrews is of course the oldest university in scotland the third oldest in the united kingdom while in contrast with the over 600 year history of saint andrews my institution the university of surrey is still a baby only half a century old in fact i have been now at surrey for 2/3 of its life i don't think anyone can say that about saint andrews just just i don't think so not quite anyway this morning i had the pleasure of delivering a general colloquium to the physics and astronomy school here where i talked about my current research area in the emerging and exciting field of quantum biology i don't blame you if you haven't heard of it which brings together theoretical physicists like me quantum chemists biochemists biophysicists spectroscopist nanotechnologists computer scientists and so on and in fact it's indicative of what we are seeing a lot in research in in science and indeed beyond science today it's becoming very much interdisciplinary in nature indeed here at saint andrews you have unquestionably one of the leading physics and astronomy departments in the in the UK in fact i note only a few days ago in the guardian i'm sure you will know of course in the guardian league tables saint andrews is number 2 now in in the UK and and of course the school of physics and astronomy is the top ranked physics and astronomy department in the country so there is much to be excited about in your research from condensed matter to photonics to exoplanets i've been very lucky in my career i spent the past two decades dividing my time roughly equally between the traditional academic duties in in in teaching and research on the one hand and public engagement activities on the other broadcasting public speaking writing earlier in my career as a full-time research physicist i followed the traditional academic route focusing on getting research funding applying for fellowships applying for grants in the hope of securing a permanent position the holy grail of any young academic but once i received my permanent position i became slightly restless yes i enjoyed the research more than anything else but i found the notion that we can learn what we can about some aspect of nature often after months or even years of research usually funded by public taxes and then publishing that work in a peer reviewed journal which is read by just a handful of other experts in the field before moving on to the next project in a continuing publish or perish cycle i found all this rather strange what's the point of learning something new about the way the world works if we don't then do something with it or at least tell the world about it and by that i don't just mean the other experts in one's discipline but wider society too so i've been very gratified to see in recent years that communicating science to the public has become not only a respectable enterprise taken up by many active scientists but also acknowledged as an important responsibility today i'd argue that the UK leads the world in science communication public engagement or science by probably more than a decade in in whether this is through broadcasting writing social media blogs podcasts public forums like science festivals that springing up all around the country to the extent that sometimes i i dare to to wonder where the CP snows 2 cultures maybe are getting closer together and and it's been quite wonderful to be given an honorary degree here amongst so many graduates from the arts we may not always speak exactly the same language but it's i find that certainly some of the most exciting discoveries in science today whether it's in astronomy or particle physics genetics medicine innovations in engineering technology these are now becoming part of the general conversation alongside the arts politics and sport but there's also another more urgent need to communicate we live in a world facing monumental challenges in healthcare in rapid technological advances particularly in AI and and robotics and automation and in the wider environment particularly when it comes to the global climate crisis it's clear that scientists can no longer afford to remain quiet when populist movements try to shout down the forces of reason and rationalism with uninformed opinion and an irrational denial of scientific evidence i believe that this it's the responsibility and duty of those of us public scientists not just to pat ourselves on the back for our latest media success but to use our public platforms to argue for the importance of rational inquiry to push back against the insidious spread of self congratulatory ignorance and to fight for evidence based politics and policies and the importance of a scientifically literate population days like today are wonderful occasions for everyone the university staff the families of the students and most importantly of course the graduates themselves i was going to say graduates but i now appreciate you are now officially graduates you've spent the last few years here working hard and you're now ready to head off into the wider world to put your knowledge to work so today really is a day to cherish and remember and it's it's it it is touching sitting in the front row watching you come up on stage some of you more open in your celebratory smiles others rather more nervous making sure you just don't trip up being that the important thing to focus on so on behalf of all the but the the graduates the i would like and myself of course i would like to thank the university of saint andrews for this honour it has been wonderful and it's now wonderful to say that i have a real association through this degree with the university of such pedigree tradition and international reputation thank you very much you may need the proof you've got a degree i call them upon professor jason kernig of the school of classics chancellor ladies and gentlemen everyone first congratulations this is a special day these are special moments in life when we get the chance to step back from everything and look back on what we have achieved there will have been times in your degree when day to day life felt like anything but a triumph times when you struggled when you had found it hard to see everything in perspective but today you can celebrate all you have accomplished through those months and years of hard work the same goes for the family and friends who've been with you along the way this is a special day for them too but this is also in a sense just the beginning what matters in education is always what comes next the way we use what we have learned in the present and the future that's one of the things we can learn from ancient greek and roman culture i spent a lot of time in my research thinking about ancient education there are some spectacularly inappropriate models ancient education could be startlingly elitist aimed primarily at young men from wealthy families in some contexts we also find an unhealthy obsession with individual teachers as authority figures the art of libanius writes in his autobiography about going to study in athens in the 4th century CE there's no such thing as a university in the modern sense in the late antique mediterranean some big cities did have impressive concentrations of well known philosophers and orators libanius had come to study with one particular teacher he described as being kidnapped and imprisoned imprisoned by the followers of one of the other professors until he agrees to change his allegiances i would think that's attempting model for freshers week no need to no need to waste all that time advising you into the right modules there are other facets of ancient education that i think still have the capacity to set a very powerful example i think that applies especially to the principle we find in a lot of ancient philosophical writing which tells us that the value of education comes from the way in which individual students and teachers respond to it in their own minds and in their own lives education is a starting point for further exploration one of the most famous ancient expressions of that comes from a work by the philosopher plutarch from a work entitled on listening for the mind he says does not require filling like a bottle but rather like wood it only requires kindling to create in it and impulse to think independently and an urgent desire for the truth he uses much less flattering imagery for bad listeners in one passage he compares them with unfledged nestlings always gaping towards the mouth of another and wanting to receive everything already prepared and predigested for plutarch listening well involves responding creatively and actively to the ideas you encounter those images and others like them have had a vast postclassical afterlife of misquotation and misattribution they've also turned into cliches i was reminded of that recently in rereading PG woodhouse's 1934 novel write home jeeves that contains one of the most disastrous and funniest of all graduation speeches in modern fiction that is the prize giving speech given by gussie fink nottle at the market snozzberry grammar school in day-to-day life he's a timid teetotaler he's terrified by the prospect of speaking in the hours before the ceremony he drinks some whiskey to give him courage and then some orange juice mixed with gin without realizing what it is the result is a comic rhetorical masterpiece he ends up insulting their headmaster along with there's people in the audience and the accused is one of the boys he's presenting a prize to of cheating in the scripture knowledge prize competition i was watching my orange juice at lunch today very carefully what i'm particularly interested in for now is a tiny moment in the previous chapter where jeeves is giving an account of his last minute advice to the speaker this is what he says i ventured to suggest that he might mention to the young gentlemen that education is a drawing out not a putting in the late lord brancaster was much addicted to presenting prizes at schools and he invariably employed this dictum that is a variant of the sentiment from plutarch especially the image they both reject which sees education as a process of filling a container the motto jeeves recommends is presented as a very conventional sentiment it's what a sober speaker ought to say on this kind of occasion presumably it's meant to seem proper but rather dull and i'm very much aware of that risk here i'm offering you a cliche a traditional platitude but for me what we get by looking back at ancient writing on education is a chance to recapture something of the freshness and power of that principle in its original context i think you can see that in the extraordinary range of imagery plutarch uses in another passage he tells us that good listeners should be like bees working together as a community but also individually transforming what they gather into honey when they have got something useful he says they fly away and get to work on it themselves of course it's important to celebrate today to look back on your education as something completed but it's also important not to put it in a box and not to assume that this is the end the education you've been through in saint andrews is something ongoing it's a starting point for all the explorations and adventures that lie ahead of you good luck thank you for all you've contributed in your time here congratulations again enjoy your day please stand for the benediction garanzia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti said kumar omnibus nobis in secular secular orum

Tua Vitam Itanium consequence or per yessum christum Dominum nostrum, Amen. Please be seated. I call upon the principle of the university. Good afternoon. I am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony. At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of the sonatas, academicals scholars become Masters, masters become doctors and people of distinction are honored. It is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation. The ceremony marks a significant rite of passage, in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation become something that they were not before and that moment is shared by everyone here in the hall today. Saint Andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change, we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. At this point I would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate Professor, Jim Al Khalili. The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the confirment of degrees of masters and doctoral level. We convert degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin, in accordance with Saint Andrews tradition. We call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap. To most though, we simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduate. This particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the breaks or trousers. Of one of this University's most famous 16th century students, John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and also, amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women. So I'm quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had different origins and was purchased for the doctoral graduation in 1696 of Sir John Arbuthnot, the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. His cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century. So as you, as you have heard, the University of Saint Andrews is Scotland's oldest university, as well as its best university. While authority to grant degrees was awarded to the University in 1413, we have not always had a building so worthy of this spectacle as the younger hall where we are today. Graduation for many years took place in the old University Library on South St. As the university drew towards its quincentenary, which was celebrated in 1911, it became apparent that we lacked a building of sufficient scale for that and other such occasions. The solution at the time of the Quincentenary was an enormous marquee, a habit which you will see later today. We have not wholly abandoned. However, it was felt that a building more fitting, the solemnity and magnificence of the university, was required and in 1919 Doctor James and Mrs Annie, Younger of the noted brewing family who lived in nearby Mount Melville, made a donation that allowed the university to plan for this handsome building. Building work commenced in 1923 during James Irvins Principalship. In overseeing the construction of the hall, principal, Ervin deliberately ensured that it was set back 30 feet from the frontage of North St so that it does not intrude upon the Long Vista looking towards the cathedral. It is out that a building planned for the future of Saint Andrews is respectful to its past. The younger hall was opened by the Duchess of York. Later Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in 1929. The intention behind this building has a further significance. James and Annie Younger asked that it be a facility open to the town of Saint Andrews, as well as the university and we are proud that that dual focus is still honoured. The ground floor is sprung for Scottish country dancing and both university and townspeople have been known to enjoy a dashing white Sergeant on its well worn Timbers. Saint Andrews is a place that gains its strength from its capacity to bring people together from across the town and across the globe and the younger Hall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time. We reopen the hall after completing a project to refit and refresh this cherished building. So to return now to today's ceremony. After students are awarded their degrees, members of Saint Salvator's Chapel Choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate on Professor Al Khalili, followed by the graduation address, which today will be delivered by Professor Jason Kernig. The ceremony will close with the benediction by the university chaplain. And the new graduates will join the academic procession. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We are delighted that you are here to share in the success of our graduates. I hope that this is a memorable and most happy day for all of you. The Kanus faculty Oasis altium.

I think it's called a reprise. I call upon the associate Dean for education in the science faculty, Dr Jonathan Isbella. Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science honoris causa Professor Jim Al Khalili. Professor Alka Lilly OBE or Jim as he is affectionately known by many, moved to the UK from Baghdad, aged 16, took his A levels and was accepted to the University of Surrey in 1982. When he graduated with a first class degree in physics, he went on to further study and in 1989 was awarded his PhD in physics for a thesis entitled Intermediate Energy Deuteron, Elastic scattering from nuclei in A3 body model. After his PhD. After his PhD, he moved to UCLA for two years as a postdoctoral fellow, and during this time there he published a number of papers, including one on the few body globber model that would later be instrumental in his highly respected work on nutrient neutron Halos. In 1992, he returned to the University of Surrey as a lecturer and over the next few years steadily gained a reputation within the field of theoretical nuclear physics and became a fellow of the Institute of Physics. During this. You're also became known as a science communicator and published his first Popular Science book, black Holes, wormholes and time machines. By 1999, Jim had established himself as a world leading figure in the field of nuclear reaction theory, with two papers which redefined the size of the neutron Halo exceeding 500 citations. This important breakthrough work enabled him to communicate with audiences all around the world as an invited speaker at the major international conferences. Of that time in 2005, he was awarded both a personal chair in physics at the University of Surrey, and simultaneously the first University of Surrey. Chair in public engagement in science. At this point, one might assume that he could relax and focus on his newly emerging media career. However, he continued with his passion for physics, and in 2007 was the youngest ever recipient of the Royal Society. Michael Faraday Medal and prize. In 2011, Jim was awarded the Institute of Physics Kelvin Medal and prize, and in 2018 he was elected to become a Fellow of the Royal Society as well as becoming President of the British Science Association. Jim has more recently begun exploring new applications of quantum mechanics. He's currently leading 5 PhD project, examining quantum tunnelling by biological molecules and how this might link to genetic mutations. So it seems that Jimmy is rather good at nuclear physics. But there's already mentioned he has more than one facet to his nature, and alongside his academic research, he's also been prolifically communicating his understanding and passion for science. To us all his long standing role as the presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific is. For many people, his best known body of work, the series in which every episode is dedicated to exploring the biography of a different and currently working scientist, is enormously popular. It's been running since 2011 and it regularly draws an audience of over 2,000,000 listeners per episode and was recognised by the broadcasting industry in 2013 with a prestigious VLV or voice of the Listener and Viewer Award for Excellence. Jim is also a prolific writer and has so far authored 14 books covering various aspects of science and its cultural history, history. This body of work has been translated now into over 25 languages and has amassed sales in the UK of over 200,000 copies. In addition to this last month for the release of his first novel, a science fiction thriller entitled Sunfall, which has already received excellent early reviews from the likes of Stephen Baxter. One of the United Kingdom's most widely respected science fiction authors. Since the late 1990s, Jim has established himself as one of the world's best known science broadcasters, presenting over 40 hours of television programmes, including two horizon documentaries and numerous multi episode history of science pieces which are used in teaching around the globe. For his television work, Jim has received 3 Grierson Trust nominations, one BAFTA nomination and awarded the International Science Film Festival of Athens Prize for a science documentary. But for Professor Alkali, one of the most highly regarded recognitions he has received is the one that links his academic and media careers. In 2016, he was awarded by Professor Stephen Hawking, the inaugural Stephen Hawking Medal of Science Communication. Professor Jim Arculli is a scientist, a humanist, a prolific author and acclaimed broadcaster and historian, a teacher who incidentally has not taken a sabbatical from teaching in over 20 years and without doubt, is a true polymath. Chancellor. In recognition of his major contribution to theoretical nuclear physics and for his work in the public engagement of science, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science or Norris Kalsa on Professor Jim Al Khalili. Tell your grandma Doctora Scantier ignores Kaiser from Ohio. Symbolum Sulphate Hobby retirement Pono. Solutions. Well, thank you very much John. That wasn't really cringeworthy standing there, listening to listening to that. Chancellor's principal graduates guests. I feel immensely proud to receive this honorary degree from Saint Andrews. As I'm sure you're all very well aware and and we we heard earlier that St. Saint Andrews is of course the oldest university in Scotland, the third oldest in the United Kingdom, while in contrast with the over 600 year history of Saint Andrews, my institution, the University of Surrey is still a baby only half a century old. In fact, I have been now at Surrey for 2/3 of its life. I don't think anyone can say that about Saint Andrews. Just. Just I don't think so. Not quite anyway. This morning I had the pleasure of delivering a general colloquium to the physics and astronomy school here where I talked about my current research area in the emerging and exciting field of quantum biology. I don't blame you if you haven't heard of it. Which brings together theoretical physicists like me, quantum chemists, biochemists, biophysicists, spectroscopist, nanotechnologists, computer scientists, and so on. And in fact it's indicative of what we are seeing a lot in research in in science, and indeed beyond science today. It's becoming very much interdisciplinary in nature. Indeed. Here at Saint Andrews, you have unquestionably one of the leading physics and astronomy departments in the in the UK. In fact I note only a few days ago in the Guardian, I'm sure you will know. Of course in the Guardian League tables, Saint Andrews is number 2 now in in the UK. And and of course, the School of Physics and Astronomy is the top ranked physics and astronomy department in the country, so there is much to be excited about in your research from condensed matter to photonics to exoplanets. I've been very lucky in my career. I spent the past two decades dividing my time roughly equally between the traditional academic duties in in in teaching and research. On the one hand, and public engagement activities on the other broadcasting, public speaking, writing earlier in my career as a full-time research physicist, I followed the traditional academic route, focusing on getting research funding. Applying for fellowships. Applying for grants in the hope of securing a permanent position, the Holy Grail of any young academic. But once I received my permanent position, I became slightly restless. Yes, I enjoyed the research more than anything else, but I found the notion that we can learn what we can about some aspect of nature, often after months or even years of research, usually funded by public taxes, and then publishing that work in a peer reviewed journal. Which is read by just a handful of other experts in the field before moving on to the next project in a continuing publish or perish cycle. I found all this rather strange. What's the point of learning something new about the way the world works? If we don't then do something with it, or at least tell the world about it. And by that I don't just mean the other experts in one's discipline. But wider society too. So I've been very gratified to see in recent years that communicating science to the public has become not only a respectable enterprise taken up by many active scientists, but also acknowledged as an important responsibility. Today, I'd argue that the UK leads the world in science, communication, public engagement or science by probably more than a decade. In in whether this is through broadcasting, writing social media, blogs, podcasts, public forums like science festivals that springing up all around the country. To the extent that sometimes I I dare to to wonder where the CP snows 2 cultures maybe are getting closer together and and it's been quite wonderful to be given an honorary degree here amongst so many graduates from the arts, we may not always speak exactly the same language. But it's I find that certainly some of the most exciting discoveries in science today, whether it's in astronomy or particle physics, genetics, medicine, innovations in engineering technology. These are now becoming part of the general conversation alongside the arts, politics and sport. But there's also another, more urgent need to communicate. We live in a world facing monumental challenges in healthcare in rapid technological advances, particularly in AI and and robotics and automation. And in the wider environment, particularly when it comes to the global climate crisis. It's clear that scientists can no longer afford to remain quiet when populist movements try to shout down the forces of reason and rationalism with uninformed opinion and an irrational denial of scientific evidence. I believe that this it's the responsibility and duty of those of us public scientists not just to pat ourselves on the back for our latest media success, but to use our public platforms to argue for the importance of rational inquiry to push back against the insidious spread of self congratulatory ignorance and to fight for evidence based politics and policies and the importance of a scientifically literate population. Days like today are wonderful occasions for everyone. The university staff, the families of the students and most importantly of course, the graduates themselves. I was going to say graduates, but I now appreciate you are now officially graduates. You've spent the last few years here working hard and you're now ready to head off into the wider world to put your knowledge to work. So today really is a day to cherish and remember, and it's it's it. It is touching, sitting in the front row, watching you come up on stage. Some of you more open in your celebratory smiles, others rather more nervous. Making sure you just don't trip up. Being that the important thing to focus on. So on behalf of all the. But the the graduates the I would like and myself. Of course I would like to thank the University of Saint Andrews for this honour. It has been wonderful and it's now wonderful to say that I have a real association through this degree with the University of such pedigree, tradition and international reputation. Thank you very much. You may need the proof you've got a degree. I call them upon Professor Jason Kernig of the School of Classics. Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen everyone. First congratulations, this is a special day. These are special moments in life when we get the chance to step back from everything and look back on what we have achieved. There will have been times in your degree when day to day life felt like anything but a triumph times when you struggled. When you had found it hard to see everything in perspective. But today you can celebrate all you have accomplished through those months and years of hard work. The same goes for the family and friends who've been with you along the way. This is a special day for them too. But this is also, in a sense just the beginning. What matters in education is always what comes next. The way we use what we have learned in the present and the future. That's one of the things we can learn from ancient Greek and Roman culture. I spent a lot of time in my research thinking about ancient education. There are some spectacularly inappropriate models. Ancient education could be startlingly elitist, aimed primarily at young men from wealthy families. In some contexts, we also find an unhealthy obsession with individual teachers as authority figures. The art of Libanius writes in his autobiography about going to study in Athens in the 4th century CE. There's no such thing as a university in the modern sense in the late antique Mediterranean, some big cities did have impressive concentrations of well known philosophers and orators. Libanius had come to study with one particular teacher he described as being kidnapped and imprisoned. Imprisoned by the followers of one of the other professors until he agrees to change his allegiances. I would think that's attempting model for freshers week. No need to. No need to waste all that time advising you into the right modules. There are other facets of ancient education that I think still have the capacity to set a very powerful example. I think that applies especially to the principle we find in a lot of ancient philosophical writing, which tells us that the value of education comes from the way in which individual students and teachers respond to it in their own minds and in their own lives. Education is a starting point for further exploration. One of the most famous ancient expressions of that comes from a work by the philosopher Plutarch from a work entitled on listening. For the mind, he says, does not require filling like a bottle, but rather like wood. It only requires kindling to create in it and impulse to think independently and an urgent desire for the truth. He uses much less flattering imagery for bad listeners in one passage, he compares them with unfledged. Nestlings, always gaping towards the mouth of another and wanting to receive everything already prepared and predigested. For Plutarch, listening well involves responding creatively and actively to the ideas you encounter. Those images and others like them have had a vast postclassical afterlife of misquotation and misattribution. They've also turned into cliches. I was reminded of that recently in rereading PG Woodhouse's 1934 novel. Write home Jeeves. That contains one of the most disastrous and funniest of all graduation speeches in modern fiction. That is the prize giving speech given by Gussie Fink, Nottle at the market Snozzberry Grammar School in day-to-day life. He's a timid teetotaler. He's terrified by the prospect of speaking in the hours before the ceremony. He drinks some whiskey to give him courage and then some orange juice mixed with gin without realizing what it is. The result is a comic rhetorical masterpiece. He ends up insulting their headmaster along with. There's people in the audience, and the accused is one of the boys. He's presenting a prize to of cheating in the Scripture knowledge prize competition. I was watching my orange juice at lunch today very carefully. What I'm particularly interested in for now is a tiny moment in the previous chapter where Jeeves is giving an account of his last minute advice to the speaker. This is what he says I ventured to suggest that he might mention to the young gentlemen that education is a drawing out, not a putting in the late Lord. Brancaster was much addicted to presenting prizes at schools, and he invariably employed this dictum. That is a variant of the sentiment from Plutarch, especially the image they both reject, which sees education as a process of filling a container. The motto Jeeves recommends is presented as a very conventional sentiment. It's what a sober speaker ought to say on this kind of occasion. Presumably it's meant to seem proper, but rather dull, and I'm very much aware of that risk here. I'm offering you a cliche, a traditional platitude. But for me, what we get by looking back at ancient writing on education is a chance to recapture something of the freshness and power of that principle. In its original context, I think you can see that in the extraordinary range of imagery Plutarch uses in another passage, he tells us that good listeners should be like bees working together as a community, but also individually transforming what they gather into honey when they have got something useful. He says they fly away and get to work on it themselves. Of course it's important to celebrate today to look back on your education as something completed, but it's also important not to put it in a box and not to assume that this is the end. The education you've been through in Saint Andrews is something ongoing. It's a starting point for all the explorations and adventures that lie ahead of you. Good luck, thank you for all you've contributed in your time here. Congratulations again. Enjoy your day. Please stand for the benediction. Garanzia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi, at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, said Kumar omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen."
