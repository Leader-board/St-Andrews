team hope quod nunc agree demur opus arte and kipea it's party equipped to him phineas natur cotinus sang to momentum glorificus it's misericordia to vitam itanium consequent periosteum christum dominum nostrum amen please be seated good morning i am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony at this gathering which officially is a meeting of the senatus academicals scholars become masters masters become doctors and people of distinction are honoured it is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation the ceremony marks a significant right of passage in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before and that moment is shared by everyone here in the hall today saint andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation we are proud to be scotland 's first and most ancient university we are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for so i will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony at this point i would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate professor leslie yellowlees the largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at masters and doctoral level we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin in accordance with saint andrews tradition we call upon the deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and we then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduand this particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the bricks or trousers of one of these universities most famous sixteenth century students john knox the major proponent of the reformation in scotland and author amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women so i am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had different origins and was purchased for the doctoral graduation in sixteen ninety six of sir john our buff not the celebrated scottish physician and satirist his cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the seventeenth century so as you've heard the university of saint andrews is scotland 's oldest university as well as its best university while authority to grant degrees was awarded to the university in fourteen thirteen we have not always had a building so worthy of this spectacle as the younger hall where we are today graduation for many years took place in the old university library on south street as the university drew towards its quincentenary which was celebrated in nineteen eleven it became apparent that we lacked a building of sufficient scale for that and other such occasions the solution at the time of the quincentenary was an enormous marquis a habit which you will see later today we have not wholly abandoned however it was felt that a building more fitting the solemnity and magnificence of the university was required and in nineteen nineteen doctor james and mrs annie younger of the noted brewing family who lived in nearby mount melville made a donation that allowed the university to plan for this handsome building building work commenced in nineteen twenty three during james irvine 's principalship in overseeing the construction of this hall principal ervin deliberately ensured that it was set back thirty feet from the frontage of north street so that it does not intrude upon the long vista looking towards the cathedral it is apt that a building planned for the future of saint andrews is respectful of its past the younger hall was opened by the duchess of york later queen elizabeth the queen mother in nineteen twenty nine the intention behind this building had a further significance james and annie younger asked that it be a facility open to the town of saint andrews as well as the university and we are proud that this dual focus is still honoured the ground floor is sprung for scottish country dancing and both university and townspeople have been known to enjoy a dashing white sergeant on its well worn timbers saint andrews is a place that gains its strength from its capacity to bring people together from across the town and across the globe and the younger hall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time we reopen the hall after completing a project to refit and refresh this cherished building to return now to today's ceremony after students are awarded their degrees members of saint salvator 's chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate doctorate on professor yellowlees followed by the graduation address which today will be delivered by professor claire petty the ceremony will close with the benediction by the chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession graduation is the highlight of the university year we are delighted that you are here to share the success of our graduates i hope this is a memorable and

three next please we i saw you kiss bar i'm flying fly why i call upon professor russell morris of the school of chemistry vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science honours koza professor leslie yellowlees in the early eighteen forties seventy seven scientists engaged in the practice of pursuit of chemistry convened a meeting and started the chemical society eventually the society changed its name to the royal society of chemistry or the RSC as we know it today it's the UK 's professional chemistry body and many of the chemists who've just you've just seen graduate will actually have been student members the headquarters of the RSC are in a beautiful building burlington house on piccadilly just across the way from fortnum and mason as with most of the fantastical buildings in london there's an impressive staircase and halfway up there's a portrait of a woman dressed in bright red and with blue hair the woman is the ninety third president of the rose of chemistry professor leslie ellis leslie was the first woman to hold the presidency of the RSC prior to this the upper echelons of the RSC where as you'd probably expect a little bit stuffy ninety two preceding RSC presidential terms were all filled by gray suited men this is as close as leslie 's ever been to a great seat at a stroke the RSE changed leslie made inclusivity a priority and suddenly the science society became an approachable body i'm pretty sure she was a shock to some but there can be no doubt have a lasting influence the RSC is a much more modern institution because of her professor leslie yellowlees is a chemist of great repute her main area of expertise is in electron paramagnetic resonance and other types of spectroscopy are subject beloved of all of our graduating students right she has applied these techniques to a wide range of different problems but in particular to those involving electrochemistry the sort of science that ends up in solar panels or the next generation of energy materials used for example in batteries leslie did her undergraduate studies at the university of edinburgh before completing a PHD in solar cell chemistry at the university of edinburgh she spent a little bit of time in australia and then in glasgow before heading back to the university of edinburgh in nineteen eighty five where she was appointed first as a demonstrator then she became a lecturer in the university of edinburgh and then professor of inorganic electrochemistry at the university of edinburgh in two thousand and five she was made head of school of chemistry there and in two thousand eleven was promoted to vice principal and head of the college of science and engineering at the university of edinburgh now i know what you're all thinking every single one of you are thinking the university of edinburgh where's that never heard of it let me assure you though that while edinburgh is a relative newcomer to the scottish universities it's not actually a bad educational establishment given her immense contribution to edinburgh it's hardly surprising that in two thousand and thirteen she was named the alumna of the year but it's not only in edinburgh where she's made an impact while we while we do enjoy a little joker our at the expense of our younger sibling the schools of chemistry at saint andrews and in edinburgh have a very close relationship since two thousand and five we've been linked as the edinburgh and saint andrew school of chemistry east chem we collaborate extremely closely and we've we've enjoyed the fruits of our shared vision of what chemistry in scotland in the twenty first century should be for the last decade and a half leslie yellowlees has been integral to this project and has served as both deputy director and director of east kem and there is no doubt that the university of edinburgh would have been a much poorer place without her but we in saint andrews have equally benefited from her imaginative leadership leslie 's used her positions at edinburgh and ask them to make a lasting impact as a champion of women in science technology engineering and maths the stem subjects she speaks on the subject around the world and her leadership and scientific roles have led to her being awarded many prizes i will list only a few in two thousand eleven she was given the international union of pure and applied chemistry that's the worldwide body that looks after chemistry she was given their distinguished woman in chemistry award in two thousand and thirteen she was awarded the medical research council 's woman scientist of the year and in two thousand and fourteen she was named by the science council as one of the hundred leading scientists in two thousand and five she was honoured by the queen with an MBE for services to science and was invited to the palace again in two thousand and fourteen where she was made a CBE for the services for her services to chemistry leslie is an inspirational advocate of science to those in power she regularly gives evidence to parliaments in the UK on diversity issues and has chaired a large number of panels of committees aimed at developing science policy in scotland and the wider UK but leslie doesn't only talk to people in power she engages with everyone from primary school pupils all the way to the MP 's she is known for her tireless work promoting science which has seen her give countless demonstration lectures she gives these everywhere and anywhere science festivals schools colleges shopping centres and even nightclubs for those for those graduating students from saint andrews today leslie 's available to tell you what a nightclub is more than anything though leslie yellowlees proves that wonderful people can be successful and have a lasting influence on those around them as you walked down the stairs at the RSC in burlington house you can tell that the subject of the portrait that looks back at you is warm colourful friendly imaginative intelligent and inspirational i think the artist did a pretty good job vice chancellor in recognition of her leadership in science and for her services to the chemistry community in particular i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science honours kaiser on the professor leslie yellowlees tay aggrading doctoris ciencia honoris cows have promoted you queers rain symbolum superette hope moretum compono congratulation first chancellor staff students and friends of the university of saint andrews it is with a real sense of pleasure and privilege that i stand here today pleasure because who doesn't love our great celebrations surrounded by those we love and a privilege because receiving a degree from this wonderful pageant university is a rare and precious thing especially when you don't have to sit an exam to get one my father hamish who was immensely proud of having a physics degree from saint andrews would have been particularly pleased today that i am graduating from what he regarded as the best university so thank you very much indeed for bestowing on me this honorary degree i'm thrilled and delighted to accept it and thank you russell thank you for your kind words russell and i go way back and he has shown excellent judgment in what he has selectively remembered today the school of chemistry at the university of of saint andrews has played a pivotal role in my career initially through research collaborations but ultimately through east kem our joint research school which has been an extremely fruitful relationship within scotland the UK and internationally i always enjoyed working with colleagues in saint andrews and thanked them for all their help and encouragement that they've given me excuse me and i have to also say you've been the best of company with which to celebrate our many successes i love graduation attending graduation ceremonies i love all the pomp and the ceremony and i love seeing everyone dressed up the graduates and the staff and their colorful robes and the guests in their sunday best already for a party out of the smiles the laughter the relief the expectation the joy but today there's also a feeling of transition the transition from being a graduate grandeur and to a graduate passing to the next phase of your life excuse me the exciting you're anxious times and these are anxious times but you've given yourself a tremendous advantage with a degree from this highly regarded university in the top one hundred in the world according to the QS rankings that's the system everyone aspires to do well in so everyone here today wishes you well and in the future remember your time at saint andrews with pride and affection remember the good times and they're not so good the high points as well as the low the hard work and the late nights the moments of revelation when it all made sense and the testing periods when nothing made sense the parties and the nine o'clock lectures expanding horizons and contracting bank balances remember the university of saint andrews will always be here for you support it and it will be here to support you so in wishing you well please allow me to offer you our wonderful graduates what might be construed as a few words of wisdom but in reality we'll be observations from my life experiences to date here are my top ten tips in no particular order number one say yes so often today we and women in particular are are encouraged to learn to say no but i would urge you to look for opportunities grasp them with both hands and not be afraid to say yes my guiding principle has been to never look back and wish i'd done something i've enjoyed the best of times and occasionally when it doesn't work out i learn and move on number two difficult colleagues you will encounter difficult colleagues accept that as a fact you don't have to like them but you do have to learn a way of working with them and that way may well be different for each one always always be professional thirdly don't try and do too much at any one time i do believe you can have it all but not all at the same time number four be true to yourself and believe in yourself because if you don't believe in yourself why should anybody else and number five if you have a problem then when you go to speak about it present a possible solution at the same time your solution may not be liked but it shows you want to move forwards and it is then up to the other party to come up with a more acceptable one six mentors find yourself a good one and then change your mentor as you change when the time feels right become a mentor mentoring is challenging but it's also very rewarding seven find out what brings you joy and providing it's legal do more of it for me it's laughing number eight give back remember the help support advice you get and then give it back tenfold and ultimate tip learn to accept criticism and rejection positively in my experience not at all easy lastly acknowledge the support you get say thank you so finally let me take a moment to thank on your and my behalf all those who have helped us arrive here today in my case a very big thank you to my husband peter who has been my biggest supporter thank you for your love and encouragement over the years i also wish to thank the university of edinburgh and the royal society of chemistry for giving me opportunities and support and to my long suffering students and on your behalf a very big and a very public thank you to everyone here today we couldn't have done it without you congratulations to you all thank you i call upon the vice principle for education professor claire petty vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen little ones and everyone here today i have the greatest honour in presenting your graduation address graduates from the biology and chemistry schools it gives me the greatest pleasure to be the one of the first to offer you many congratulations on your significant achievement i truly believe there's something really special about being a graduate from the university of saint andrews it's really hard to accurately define the uniqueness of the student experience here at saint andrews and precisely what it is that has made your time here so special some might say that the student experience is down to the dedication of your teachers those that have enthused and facilitated your learner journey with research led and research informed teaching some may say it's down to the professionalism of the hall wardens the janitors the cleaners that have tidied up after you the school technicians the administrative staff student services and the careers of buyers of all who have helped you on your way to your journey here today and finally some might say it's just the nature of the medieval town in which we find ourselves the bubble that is saint andrews however my observation is that the experience that you have here is self made it's you the students that makes saint andrews what it is you have fashioned the most supportive and caring environment for each other a community in which you look out for and support your fellow students you've made an atmosphere in which you generate your own fund your own parties and you manage without the nightclub you organise a network of societies parties sporting clubs that join you altogether to be the students of saint andrews with a common interest and you help us do the work that we do through your class representatives your school presidents and your sabbatical officers to help us improve your experience every year in your time here you will have formed lifelong friendships perhaps even relationships and now you go on to join a network of supporting alumni who will always offer hospitality to their fellow graduates wherever in the world you meet and believe me you will meet each other in the most unlikely of places those of you that are making their second or perhaps even third graduation today to receive a postgraduate degree you have my special congratulations you have completed a journey that's accomplished by very few a journey that by is by its very nature unique and original and sometimes lonely you can be immensely proud of the advances that you have made in your discipline family and friends as a mother of two graduates of the university of saint andrews i'm able to say with some authenticity that i fully appreciate your overwhelming pride today i share your satisfaction and i share your apprehension it's a changed world into which your loved one is graduating today a world in which we have significant concern for climate change the consequences of those graduating today can expect to experience in their lifetime unless we make significant adjustments to our way of life it is a world of political change where tolerance and international collaborations are challenged be reassured though these graduates today have experienced a community in which we all respect and value diversity where we embrace and welcome our international connections and where consideration for others and harmony our central values they leave with the critical and analytical skills necessary to unpick truths and to challenge dogma and to make evidence based arguments for norm on behalf of these graduates today i would like to thank you all for your support during their study here at saint andrews actually second thoughts i think they should thank you themselves graduates what i want you to do i want you to stand up and i want you to turn round one hundred and eighty degrees and i want to give those that have give you to give those that have supported you a big round of applause up you get turn around and give them a huge round of applause and say thank you very much OK you can sit down now so graduates what next some of you have may have your immediate future already mapped out in front of you and some are still considering what you're going to do next personally i'm pinning my hopes on all of you to yours your mind and your skills to support a sustainable future for our planet in the words of our honorary graduate sir david attenborough he said we need to move beyond guilt or blame and to get on with the practical tasks in hand he also said young people they care they actually believe that humanity 's human species has no right to destroy or despoil regardless so whatever in whatever you choose to do going forward enjoy every moment but relish life with a look to the future of our planet and get on with the practical tasks in hand thank you very much please stand for the benediction gratia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular

saint andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation we are proud to be scotland's first and most ancient university we are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for so i will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony at this point i would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate professor leslie yellowlees the largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at masters and doctoral level we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin in accordance with saint andrews tradition we call upon the deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and we then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduand this particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the bricks or trousers of one of these universities most famous 16th century students john knox the major proponent of the reformation in scotland and author amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women so i am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had different origins and was purchased for the doctoral graduation in 1696 of sir john our buff not the celebrated scottish physician and satirist his cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century so as you've heard the university of saint andrews is scotland's oldest university as well as its best university while authority to grant degrees was awarded to the university in 1413 we have not always had a building so worthy of this spectacle as the younger hall where we are today graduation for many years took place in the old university library on south st as the university drew towards its quincentenary which was celebrated in 1911 it became apparent that we lacked a building of sufficient scale for that and other such occasions the solution at the time of the quincentenary was an enormous marquis a habit which you will see later today we have not wholly abandoned however it was felt that a building more fitting the solemnity and magnificence of the university was required and in 1919 doctor james and mrs annie younger of the noted brewing family who lived in nearby mount melville made a donation that allowed the university to plan for this handsome building building work commenced in 1923 during james irvine's principalship in overseeing the construction of this hall principal ervin deliberately ensured that it was set back 30 feet from the frontage of north st so that it does not intrude upon the long vista looking towards the cathedral it is apt that a building planned for the future of saint andrews is respectful of its past the younger hall was opened by the duchess of york later queen elizabeth the queen mother in 1929 the intention behind this building had a further significance james and annie younger asked that it be a facility open to the town of saint andrews as well as the university and we are proud that this dual focus is still honoured the ground floor is sprung for scottish country dancing and both university and townspeople have been known to enjoy a dashing white sergeant on its well worn timbers saint andrews is a place that gains its strength from its capacity to bring people together from across the town and across the globe and the younger hall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time we reopen the hall after completing a project to refit and refresh this cherished building to return now to today's ceremony after students are awarded their degrees members of saint salvator's chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate doctorate on professor yellowlees followed by the graduation address which today will be delivered by professor claire petty the ceremony will close with the benediction by the chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession graduation is the highlight of the university year we are delighted that you are here to share the success of our graduates i hope this is a memorable and happy day for all of you decanus spackled hartis the NCI vice chancellor i have the honor to present for the degree of

honours koza professor leslie yellowlees in the early 1840s seventy 7 scientists engaged in the practice of pursuit of chemistry convened a meeting and started the chemical society eventually the society changed its name to the royal society of chemistry or the RSC as we know it today it's the UK's professional chemistry body and many of the chemists who've just you've just seen graduate will actually have been student members the headquarters of the RSC are in a beautiful building burlington house on piccadilly just across the way from fortnum and mason as with most of the fantastical buildings in london there's an impressive staircase and halfway up there's a portrait of a woman dressed in bright red and with blue hair the woman is the 93rd president of the rose of chemistry professor leslie ellis leslie was the first woman to hold the presidency of the RSC prior to this the upper echelons of the RSC where as you'd probably expect a little bit stuffy 92 preceding RSC presidential terms were all filled by gray suited men this is as close as leslie's ever been to a great seat at a stroke the RSE changed leslie made inclusivity a priority and suddenly the science society became an approachable body i'm pretty sure she was a shock to some but there can be no doubt have a lasting influence the RSC is a much more modern institution because of her professor leslie yellowlees is a chemist of great repute her main area of expertise is in electron paramagnetic resonance and other types of spectroscopy are subject beloved of all of our graduating students right she has applied these techniques to a wide range of different problems but in particular to those involving electrochemistry the sort of science that ends up in solar panels or the next generation of energy materials used for example in batteries leslie did her undergraduate studies at the university of edinburgh before completing a PHD in solar cell chemistry at the university of edinburgh she spent a little bit of time in australia and then in glasgow before heading back to the university of edinburgh in 1985 where she was appointed first as a demonstrator then she became a lecturer in the university of edinburgh and then professor of inorganic electrochemistry at the university of edinburgh in 2005 she was made head of school of chemistry there and in 2011 was promoted to vice principal and head of the college of science and engineering at the university of edinburgh now i know what you're all thinking every single one of you are thinking the university of edinburgh where's that never heard of it let me assure you though that while edinburgh is a relative newcomer to the scottish universities it's not actually a bad educational establishment given her immense contribution to edinburgh it's hardly surprising that in 2013 she was named the alumna of the year but it's not only in edinburgh where she's made an impact while we while we do enjoy a little joker our at the expense of our younger sibling the schools of chemistry at saint andrews and in edinburgh have a very close relationship since 2005 we've been linked as the edinburgh and saint andrew school of chemistry east chem we collaborate extremely closely and we've we've enjoyed the fruits of our shared vision of what chemistry in scotland in the 21st century should be for the last decade and a half leslie yellowlees has been integral to this project and has served as both deputy director and director of east kem and there is no doubt that the university of edinburgh would have been a much poorer place without her but we in saint andrews have equally benefited from her imaginative leadership leslie's used her positions at edinburgh and ask them to make a lasting impact as a champion of women in science technology engineering and maths the stem subjects she speaks on the subject around the world and her leadership and scientific roles have led to her being awarded many prizes i will list only a few in 2011 she was given the international union of pure and applied chemistry that's the worldwide body that looks after chemistry she was given their distinguished woman in chemistry award in 2013 she was awarded the medical research council's woman scientist of the year and in 2014 she was named by the science council as one of the 100 leading scientists in 2005 she was honoured by the queen with an MBE for services to science and was invited to the palace again in 2014 where she was made a CBE for the services for her services to chemistry leslie is an inspirational advocate of science to those in power she regularly gives evidence to parliaments in the UK on diversity issues and has chaired a large number of panels of committees aimed at developing science policy in scotland and the wider UK but leslie doesn't only talk to people in power she engages with everyone from primary school pupils all the way to the MP's she is known for her tireless work promoting science which has seen her give countless demonstration lectures she gives these everywhere and anywhere science festivals schools colleges shopping centres and even nightclubs for those for those graduating students from saint andrews today leslie's available to tell you what a nightclub is more than anything though leslie yellowlees proves that wonderful people can be successful and have a lasting influence on those around them as you walked down the stairs at the RSC in burlington house you can tell that the subject of the portrait that looks back at you is warm colourful friendly imaginative intelligent and inspirational i think the artist did a pretty good job vice chancellor in recognition of her leadership in science and for her services to the chemistry community in particular i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science honours kaiser on the professor leslie yellowlees tay aggrading doctoris ciencia honoris cows have promoted you queers rain symbolum superette hope moretum compono congratulation first chancellor staff students and friends of the university of saint andrews it is with a real sense of pleasure and privilege that i stand here today pleasure because who doesn't love our great celebrations surrounded by those we love and a privilege because receiving a degree from this wonderful pageant university is a rare and precious thing especially when you don't have to sit an exam to get one my father hamish who was immensely proud of having a physics degree from saint andrews would have been particularly pleased today that i am graduating from what he regarded as the best university so thank you very much indeed for bestowing on me this honorary degree i'm thrilled and delighted to accept it and thank you russell thank you for your kind words russell and i go way back and he has shown excellent judgment in what he has selectively remembered today the school of chemistry at the university of of saint andrews has played a pivotal role in my career initially through research collaborations but ultimately through east kem our joint research school which has been an extremely fruitful relationship within scotland the UK and internationally i always enjoyed working with colleagues in saint andrews and thanked them for all their help and encouragement that they've given me excuse me and i have to also say you've been the best of company with which to celebrate our many successes i love graduation attending graduation ceremonies i love all the pomp and the ceremony and i love seeing everyone dressed up the graduates and the staff and their colorful robes and the guests in their sunday best already for a party out of the smiles the laughter the relief the expectation the joy but today there's also a feeling of transition the transition from being a graduate grandeur and to a graduate passing to the next phase of your life excuse me the exciting you're anxious times and these are anxious times but you've given yourself a tremendous advantage with a degree from this highly regarded university in the top 100 in the world according to the QS rankings that's the system everyone aspires to do well in so everyone here today wishes you well and in the future remember your time at saint andrews with pride and affection remember the good times and they're not so good the high points as well as the low the hard work and the late nights the moments of revelation when it all made sense and the testing periods when nothing made sense the parties and the 9:00 o'clock lectures expanding horizons and contracting bank balances remember the university of saint andrews will always be here for you support it and it will be here to support you so in wishing you well please allow me to offer you our wonderful graduates what might be construed as a few words of wisdom but in reality we'll be observations from my life experiences to date here are my top 10 tips in no particular order number one say yes so often today we and women in particular are are encouraged to learn to say no but i would urge you to look for opportunities grasp them with both hands and not be afraid to say yes my guiding principle has been to never look back and wish i'd done something i've enjoyed the best of times and occasionally when it doesn't work out i learn and move on number two difficult colleagues you will encounter difficult colleagues accept that as a fact you don't have to like them but you do have to learn a way of working with them and that way may well be different for each one always always be professional thirdly don't try and do too much at any one time i do believe you can have it all but not all at the same time #4 be true to yourself and believe in yourself because if you don't believe in yourself why should anybody else and #5 if you have a problem then when you go to speak about it present a possible solution at the same time your solution may not be liked but it shows you want to move forwards and it is then up to the other party to come up with a more acceptable 1 6 mentors find yourself a good one and then change your mentor as you change when the time feels right become a mentor mentoring is challenging but it's also very rewarding 7 find out what brings you joy and providing it's legal do more of it for me it's laughing #8 give back remember the help support advice you get and then give it back tenfold and ultimate tip learn to accept criticism and rejection positively in my experience not at all easy lastly acknowledge the support you get say thank you so finally let me take a moment to thank on your and my behalf all those who have helped us arrive here today in my case a very big thank you to my husband peter who has been my biggest supporter thank you for your love and encouragement over the years i also wish to thank the university of edinburgh and the royal society of chemistry for giving me opportunities and support and to my long suffering students and on your behalf a very big and a very public thank you to everyone here today we couldn't have done it without you congratulations to you all thank you i call upon the vice principle for education professor claire petty vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen little ones and everyone here today i have the greatest honour in presenting your graduation address graduates from the biology and chemistry schools it gives me the greatest pleasure to be the one of the first to offer you many congratulations on your significant achievement i truly believe there's something really special about being a graduate from the university of saint andrews it's really hard to accurately define the uniqueness of the student experience here at saint andrews and precisely what it is that has made your time here so special some might say that the student experience is down to the dedication of your teachers those that have enthused and facilitated your learner journey with research led and research informed teaching some may say it's down to the professionalism of the hall wardens the janitors the cleaners that have tidied up after you the school technicians the administrative staff student services and the careers of buyers of all who have helped you on your way to your journey here today and finally some might say it's just the nature of the medieval town in which we find ourselves the bubble that is saint andrews however my observation is that the experience that you have here is self made it's you the students that makes saint andrews what it is you have fashioned the most supportive and caring environment for each other a community in which you look out for and support your fellow students you've made an atmosphere in which you generate your own fund your own parties and you manage without the nightclub you organise a network of societies parties sporting clubs that join you altogether to be the students of saint andrews with a common interest and you help us do the work that we do through your class representatives your school presidents and your sabbatical officers to help us improve your experience every year in your time here you will have formed lifelong friendships perhaps even relationships and now you go on to join a network of supporting alumni who will always offer hospitality to their fellow graduates wherever in the world you meet and believe me you will meet each other in the most unlikely of places those of you that are making their second or perhaps even third graduation today to receive a postgraduate degree you have my special congratulations you have completed a journey that's accomplished by very few a journey that by is by its very nature unique and original and sometimes lonely you can be immensely proud of the advances that you have made in your discipline family and friends as a mother of two graduates of the university of saint andrews i'm able to say with some authenticity that i fully appreciate your overwhelming pride today i share your satisfaction and i share your apprehension it's a changed world into which your loved one is graduating today a world in which we have significant concern for climate change the consequences of those graduating today can expect to experience in their lifetime unless we make significant adjustments to our way of life it is a world of political change where tolerance and international collaborations are challenged be reassured though these graduates today have experienced a community in which we all respect and value diversity where we embrace and welcome our international connections and where consideration for others and harmony our central values they leave with the critical and analytical skills necessary to unpick truths and to challenge dogma and to make evidence based arguments for norm on behalf of these graduates today i would like to thank you all for your support during their study here at saint andrews actually second thoughts i think they should thank you themselves graduates what i want you to do i want you to stand up and i want you to turn round 180 degrees and i want to give those that have give you to give those that have supported you a big round of applause up you get turn around and give them a huge round of applause and say thank you very much OK you can sit down now so graduates what next some of you have may have your immediate future already mapped out in front of you and some are still considering what you're going to do next personally i'm pinning my hopes on all of you to yours your mind and your skills to support a sustainable future for our planet in the words of our honorary graduate sir david attenborough he said we need to move beyond guilt or blame and to get on with the practical tasks in hand he also said young people they care they actually believe that humanity's human species has no right to destroy or despoil regardless so whatever in whatever you choose to do going forward enjoy every moment but relish life with a look to the future of our planet and get on with the practical tasks in hand thank you very much please stand for the benediction

At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of the Senatus Academicals, scholars become Masters, Masters become doctors, and people of distinction are honoured. It is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation. The ceremony marks a significant right of passage, in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before, and that moment is shared by everyone here in the hall today. Saint Andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking. Important in all of this is that as we change, we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. At this point I would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate Professor Leslie Yellowlees. The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at Masters and doctoral level. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin, in accordance with Saint Andrews tradition. We call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap. To most though, we simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduand. This particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the bricks or trousers of one of these universities. Most famous 16th century students. John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and author, amongst other things, of the first blast of the trumpet. Against the monstrous regiment of women. So I am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this CAP actually had different origins and was purchased for the doctoral graduation in 1696 of Sir John our buff, not the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. His cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century. So, as you've heard, the University of Saint Andrews is Scotland's oldest university, as well as its best university. While authority to grant degrees was awarded to the University in 1413, we have not always had a building. So worthy of this spectacle as the younger hall where we are today graduation for many years took place in the old University Library on South St as the university drew towards its quincentenary, which was celebrated in 1911. It became apparent that we lacked a building of sufficient scale for that and other such occasions. The solution at the time of the Quincentenary was an enormous Marquis, a habit which you will see later today. We have not wholly abandoned, however, it was felt that a building more fitting, the solemnity and magnificence of the university, was required and in 1919 Doctor James and Mrs Annie, Younger of the noted brewing family who lived in nearby Mount Melville, made a donation that allowed the university to plan for this handsome building. Building work commenced in 1923 during James Irvine's principalship in overseeing the construction of this hall. Principal Ervin deliberately ensured that it was set back 30 feet from the frontage of North St so that it does not intrude upon the Long Vista. Looking towards the cathedral. It is apt that a building planned for the future of Saint Andrews is respectful of its past. The younger hall was opened by the Duchess of York. Later Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in 1929. The intention behind this building had a further significance. James and Annie Younger asked that it be a facility open to the town of Saint Andrews, as well as the university and we are proud that this dual focus is still honoured. The ground floor is sprung for Scottish country dancing, and both university and townspeople have been known to enjoy a dashing white Sergeant on its well worn Timbers. Saint Andrews is a place that gains its strength from its capacity to bring people together from across the town and across the globe and the younger Hall gives form to this that will continue when in a couple of years time. We reopen the hall after completing a project to refit and refresh this cherished building. To return now to today's ceremony. After students are awarded their degrees, members of Saint Salvator's Chapel Choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate doctorate on Professor Yellowlees, followed by the graduation address, which today will be delivered by Professor Claire Petty. The ceremony will close with the benediction by the chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We are delighted that you are here to share the success of our graduates. I hope this is a memorable and happy day for all of you. Decanus Spackled hartis the NCI.

I call upon Professor Russell Morris of the School of Chemistry. Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science honours. Koza professor Leslie yellowlees. In the early 1840s, seventy 7 scientists engaged in the practice of pursuit of chemistry, convened a meeting, and started the chemical society. Eventually, the society changed its name to the Royal Society of Chemistry or the RSC as we know it today. It's the UK's professional chemistry body and many of the chemists who've just you've just seen graduate will actually have been student members. The headquarters of the RSC are in a beautiful building Burlington House on Piccadilly, just across the way from Fortnum and Mason. As with most of the fantastical buildings in London, there's an impressive staircase and halfway up, there's a portrait of a woman. Dressed in bright red and with blue hair. The woman is the 93rd president of the Rose of chemistry professor Leslie Ellis Leslie was the first woman to hold the presidency of the RSC prior to this, the upper echelons of the RSC where as you'd probably expect a little bit stuffy. 92 preceding RSC presidential terms were all filled by Gray suited men. This is as close as Leslie's ever been to a great seat. At a stroke, the RSE changed. Leslie made inclusivity a priority, and suddenly the science Society became an approachable body. I'm pretty sure she was a shock to some. But there can be no doubt have a lasting influence. The RSC is a much more modern institution because of her. Professor Leslie Yellowlees is a chemist of great repute, her main area of expertise is in electron paramagnetic resonance and other types of spectroscopy are subject beloved of all of our graduating students, right? She has applied these techniques to a wide range of different problems, but in particular to those involving electrochemistry. The sort of science that ends up in solar panels. Or the next generation of energy materials used. For example in batteries. Leslie did her undergraduate studies at the University of Edinburgh before completing a PhD in solar cell chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. She spent a little bit of time in Australia and then in Glasgow. Before heading back to the University of Edinburgh in 1985, where she was appointed first as a demonstrator. Then she became a lecturer in the University of Edinburgh and then Professor of inorganic electrochemistry at the University of Edinburgh. In 2005 she was made head of School of Chemistry there and in 2011 was promoted to vice principal and head of the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. Now I know what you're all thinking. Every single one of you are thinking. The University of Edinburgh where's that? Never heard of it. Let me assure you though. That while Edinburgh is a relative newcomer to the Scottish universities. It's not actually a bad educational establishment. Given her immense contribution to Edinburgh, it's hardly surprising that in 2013 she was named the alumna of the Year. But it's not only in Edinburgh, where she's made an impact while we. While we do enjoy a little joker our at the expense of our younger sibling. The schools of chemistry at Saint Andrews and in Edinburgh have a very close relationship. Since 2005 we've been linked as the Edinburgh and Saint Andrew School of Chemistry, East Chem. We collaborate extremely closely and we've we've enjoyed the fruits of our shared vision of what chemistry in Scotland in the 21st century should be for the last decade and a half. Leslie Yellowlees has been integral to this project and has served as both deputy director and director of East Kem, and there is no doubt that the University of Edinburgh would have been a much poorer place without her. But we in Saint Andrews have equally benefited from her imaginative leadership. Leslie's used her positions at Edinburgh and ask them to make a lasting impact as a champion of women in science, technology, engineering, and maths. The STEM subjects she speaks on the subject around the world and her leadership and scientific roles have led to her being awarded many prizes. I will list only a few. In 2011 she was given the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. That's the worldwide body that looks after chemistry. She was given their distinguished woman in Chemistry award. In 2013, she was awarded the Medical Research Council's woman scientist of the Year, and in 2014 she was named by the Science Council as one of the 100 leading scientists. In 2005 she was honoured by the Queen with an MBE for services to science, and was invited to the palace again in 2014, where she was made a CBE for the services for her services to chemistry. Leslie is an inspirational advocate of science to those in power. She regularly gives evidence to parliaments in the UK on diversity issues, and has chaired a large number of panels of committees aimed at developing science policy in Scotland and the wider UK. But Leslie doesn't only talk to people in power, she engages with everyone. From primary school pupils all the way to the MP's, she is known for her tireless work promoting science which has seen her give countless demonstration lectures. She gives these everywhere and anywhere science, festivals, schools, colleges, shopping centres and even nightclubs. For those for those graduating students from Saint Andrews today, Leslie's available to tell you what a nightclub is. More than anything, though, Leslie Yellowlees proves that wonderful people can be successful and have a lasting influence on those around them. As you walked down the stairs at the RSC in Burlington House, you can tell that the subject of the portrait that looks back at you is warm, colourful, friendly, imaginative, intelligent and inspirational. I think the artist did a pretty good job. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of her leadership in science and for her services to the chemistry community in particular, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science honours Kaiser on the Professor Leslie Yellowlees. Tay Aggrading Doctoris Ciencia honoris cows have promoted you queers rain symbolum superette hope moretum compono. Congratulation first chancellor. Staff. Students and friends of the University of Saint Andrews. It is with a real sense of pleasure and privilege that I stand here today pleasure, because who doesn't love our great celebrations surrounded by those we love? And a privilege, because receiving a degree from this wonderful pageant university is a rare and precious thing, especially when you don't have to sit an exam to get one. My father Hamish, who was immensely proud of having a physics degree from Saint Andrews, would have been particularly pleased today that I am graduating from what he regarded as the best university. So thank you very much indeed for bestowing on me this honorary degree. I'm thrilled and delighted to accept it. And thank you, Russell. Thank you for your kind words, Russell. And I go way back. And he has shown excellent judgment in what he has selectively remembered today. The School of Chemistry at the University of of Saint Andrews has played a pivotal role in my career. Initially through research collaborations, but ultimately through East Kem, our joint research school. Which has been an extremely fruitful relationship within Scotland, the UK and internationally. I always enjoyed working with colleagues in Saint Andrews and thanked them for all their help and encouragement that they've given me. Excuse me and I have to also say. You've been the best of company with which to celebrate our many successes. I love graduation attending graduation ceremonies. I love all the pomp and the ceremony and I love seeing everyone dressed up the graduates and the staff and their colorful robes and the guests in their Sunday best. Already for a party. Out of the smiles the laughter, the relief, the expectation, the joy. But today there's also a feeling of transition. The transition from being a graduate grandeur and to a graduate passing to the next phase of your life. Excuse me the exciting you're anxious times. And these are anxious times, but you've given yourself a tremendous advantage with a degree from this highly regarded university. In the top 100 in the world according to the QS rankings, that's the system everyone aspires to do well in. So everyone here today wishes you well and in the future. Remember your time at Saint Andrews with pride and affection. Remember the good times? And they're not so good. The high points as well as the low, the hard work and the late nights. The moments of revelation when it all made sense, and the testing periods when nothing made sense. The parties. And the 9:00 o'clock lectures. Expanding horizons and contracting bank balances. Remember, the University of Saint Andrews will always be here for you. Support it and it will be here to support you. So in wishing you well. Please allow me to offer you our wonderful graduates. What might be construed as a few words of wisdom. But in reality, we'll be observations from my life experiences to date. Here are my top 10 tips, in no particular order. Number one, say yes. So often today we and women in particular are are encouraged to learn to say no, but I would urge you to look for opportunities, grasp them with both hands and not be afraid to say yes. My guiding principle has been to never look back and wish I'd done something. I've enjoyed the best of times, and occasionally when it doesn't work out, I learn and move on. Number two difficult colleagues you will encounter difficult colleagues. Accept that as a fact. You don't have to like them, but you do have to learn a way of working with them, and that way may well be different for each one. Always, always be professional. Thirdly don't try and do too much at any one time. I do believe you can have it all. But not all at the same time. #4 be true to yourself and believe in yourself. Because if you don't believe in yourself, why should anybody else? And #5 if you have a problem. Then when you go to speak about it, present a possible solution at the same time. Your solution may not be liked. But it shows you want to move forwards and it is then up to the other party to come up with a more acceptable 1. 6 mentors find yourself a good one and then change your mentor as you change when the time feels right, become a mentor. Mentoring is challenging, but it's also very rewarding. 7. Find out what brings you joy and. Providing it's legal, do more of it. For me it's laughing. #8 give back. Remember the help support advice you get and then give it back tenfold. And ultimate tip, learn to accept criticism and rejection positively. In my experience, not at all easy. Lastly, acknowledge the support you get, say thank you. So finally let me take a moment to thank on your and my behalf. All those who have helped us arrive here today. In my case, a very big thank you to my husband Peter, who has been my biggest supporter. Thank you for your love and encouragement over the years. I also wish to thank the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Society of Chemistry for giving me opportunities and support. And to my long suffering students. And on your behalf. A very big and a very public thank you to everyone here today. We couldn't have done it without you. Congratulations to you all, thank you. I call upon the vice principle for education Professor Claire Petty. Vice Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, little ones and everyone here today. I have the greatest honour in presenting your graduation address. Graduates from the biology and chemistry schools. It gives me the greatest pleasure to be the one of the first to offer you. Many congratulations on your significant achievement. I truly believe there's something really special about being a graduate from the University of Saint Andrews. It's really hard to accurately define the uniqueness of the student experience here at Saint Andrews, and precisely what it is that has made your time here so special. Some might say that the student experience is down to the dedication of your teachers. Those that have enthused. And facilitated your learner journey with research led and research informed teaching. Some may say it's down to the professionalism of the hall wardens, the janitors, the cleaners that have tidied up after you. The school technicians, the administrative Staff, Student Services, and the careers of buyers of all who have helped you on your way to your journey here today. And finally, some might say it's just the nature of the medieval town in which we find ourselves the bubble that is Saint Andrews. However, my observation. Is that the experience that you have here is self made? It's you, the students. That makes Saint Andrews what it is. You have fashioned the most supportive and caring environment for each other. A community in which you look out for and support your fellow students. You've made an atmosphere in which you generate your own fund, your own parties, and you manage without the nightclub. You organise a network of societies, parties, sporting clubs that join you altogether to be the students of Saint Andrews, with a common interest and you help us do the work that we do through your class representatives, your school presidents, and your sabbatical officers to help us improve your experience every year. In your time here, you will have formed lifelong friendships. Perhaps even relationships. And now you go on. To join a network of supporting alumni who will always offer hospitality to their fellow graduates, wherever in the world you meet and believe me, you will meet each other in the most unlikely of places. Those of you that are making. Their second, or perhaps even third graduation today to receive a postgraduate degree. You have my special congratulations. You have completed a journey that's accomplished by very few. A journey that by is by its very nature, unique and original and sometimes lonely. You can be immensely proud of the advances that you have made in your discipline. Family and friends. As a mother of two graduates of the University of Saint Andrews, I'm able to say with some authenticity that I fully appreciate your overwhelming pride today. I share your satisfaction and I share your apprehension. It's a changed world into which your loved one is graduating today, a world in which we have significant concern for climate change. The consequences of those graduating today can expect to experience in their lifetime unless we make significant adjustments to our way of life. It is a world of political change where tolerance and international collaborations are challenged. Be reassured though, these graduates today. Have experienced a community in which we all respect and value diversity where we embrace and welcome our international connections and where consideration for others and harmony our central values they leave. With the critical and analytical skills necessary to unpick truths and to challenge dogma and to make evidence based arguments for norm. On behalf of these graduates today, I would like to thank you all for your support during their study here at Saint Andrews. Actually, second thoughts. I think they should thank you themselves graduates. What I want you to do. I want you to stand up. And I want you to turn round 180 degrees and I want to give those that have give you to give those that have supported you a big round of applause Up you get. Turn around and give them a huge round of applause and say thank you very much. OK, you can sit down now. So graduates what next? Some of you have may have your immediate future already mapped out in front of you and some are still considering what you're going to do next. Personally, I'm pinning my hopes on all of you to yours, your mind and your skills to support a sustainable future for our planet. In the words of our honorary graduate Sir David Attenborough, he said we need to move beyond guilt or blame and to get on with the practical tasks in hand. He also said young people. They care, they actually believe that humanity's human species has no right to destroy or despoil regardless. So whatever in whatever you choose to do, going forward, enjoy every moment, but relish life with a look to the future of our planet and get on with the practical tasks in hand. Thank you very much. Please stand for the benediction. Gratia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi. At Caritas day at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen."
