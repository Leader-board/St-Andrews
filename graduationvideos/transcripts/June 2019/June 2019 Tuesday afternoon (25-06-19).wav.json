knowledge and customary status he was fortunate to be born into a family who recognised that such privileges carry heavy responsibilities to cultural custodianship and duties to political leadership two year tours grandfather challenged colonialism 's grip on samoa and his father was amongst those guiding the country to independence in nineteen sixty two and he shared the duty of being samoa 's first head of state alongside these genealogical connections to some of the most paramount and royal families in samoa two year tours family are also connected to sweden the united states and scotland when robert lewis stevenson settled down in samoa in eighteen ninety he became great friends with tuya tours great grandparents two year tours great grandmother spoke with a scots brogue acquired through her two teenage schooling here his great grandfather sold stephenson the hilltop vailima estate reportedly for a stiff price where the scottish writer known locally as tusitala the teller of tales built a house lived well and is now buried two year tours many customary titles carry the achievements of his forebears yet he has honoured added to and grown these names and knowledges through a life devoted to political service and through his outstanding achievements and contributions to cultural custodianship and to academic scholarship which we are honouring today from nineteen seventy six to nineteen eighty two two year tua served two terms as prime minister and from two thousand and seven to two thousand and seventeen he served two terms as head of state disturbed by the growing forces of globalization and the waning relevance of samoan customary knowledge and language in the nineteen seventies two year tour was encouraged by his wife her highness massie offo filifolia imo tamasese to do something about it by writing a book in the samoan language two year tour has subsequently written several more books dozens of scholarly articles and keynote addresses bringing some on customary knowledge to international audiences his topics have covered climate change specific leadership fragrance cultural taboos political discourse traditional navigation and bioethics his highness is highly respected as one of the four most experts on samoan language culture and philosophy he is renowned across the pacific region as a leading voice on finding pacific ways to decolonize the thinking behind the social economic and environmental effects of a globalizing world in the nineteen eighties in the late nineteen eighties two year tour was part of the south commission whose report the challenge to the south sought to upgrade the international community by treating developing countries as equals in two thousand and five toyota tour served as the oceania representative to the pontifical interreligious dialogue commission and he wrote harmony in the samoan indigenous religion finds equivalence and balance in all living things to respect nature is to respect man to respect one 's fellow men is to respect oneself respecting the soul is to is to respect the body and mind respecting life is to respect death these scholarly interventions develop a method of using the samoan indigenous reference to engage contemporary issues in doing so to ear tour avoids both reverential adherence to and also unthinking abandonment of samoan heritage aiming to find new ways of living in harmony in our ever changing world toria to a scholarship has been recognised through academic fellowships in several universities in new zealand and australia and has been prominent through international keynote addresses including those at the east west centre in hawaii and the university of the south pacific in fiji to hear to us served as chancellor to the university of the south pacific from two thousand and eight to nine and was chancellor to the national university of samoa from two thousand and eight to two thousand and thirteen two year tours method of the samoan indigenous reference creates space for calling out vitally important and detrimental globalised conventions that are otherwise difficult to speak about this method and body of work clearly holds relevance and influence beyond samoa ahead of the UN climate summit in copenhagen in two thousand and nine two year tour used samoan indigenous references to the way fishermen address and bestow honour on a shoal of mackerel who reciprocate by respectfully giving themselves in return to challenge the arrogance and greed of humanity separating itself from and then dominating all other forms of life when samoa hosted the UN conference of small island developing states in two in twenty fourteen toyota tour took the UN secretary general aboard the hokulea a majestic double holed voyaging canoe of the kind pacific islanders had used to explore and settle every island across a third of the earth 's surface by the time the university of saint andrews was founded six hundred years ago banki moon caught the spirit of samoan indigenous reference in declaring that we are all in the same canoe sailing aboard the earth on a journey through the stars in twenty fifteen in the lead up to the UN climate summit in paris two yetur paired his view of climate change from the perspective of fish with a speech to the european union in brussels pointing to a samoan indigenous reference in the refusal of two starlings to break from their enjoyable coupling despite being knocked off their conjugal branch the example warned the international community to maintain its dialogue despite the difficulties in fact it was pacific leadership which catalysed the coalition of high ambition that reached the paris climate agreement two year two is insistence that getting into the global conversation to protect the most beautiful things in life needs the backup of great scholarship is a lesson all of us are celebrating here today vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to cultural custodianship and academic scholarship i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters honoris causa on his highness tuya tuya tupua tamasese taisi effie we can clap a

honor to receive this award but in truth the honor belongs to my forebears it is they who had gathered and passed on to successive generations like mine the history culture customs and usage which is now ours the most significant challenge for indigenous people all over the globe is how to keep our indigenous knowledges alive and thriving alongside the best in the world when are theologies and philosophies are taken seriously by the top universities in the world there is much to celebrate and be grateful for it is therefore high honor for me to have the work of my forebears recognized by this very esteemed university on behalf of my forebears and my family i want to thank the university of sydney andrews for this special recognition i thank in particular madam vice chancellor and principal professor sally mapstone and the center for pacific studies for the warm support and sponsorship i also acknowledge the loving support of my wife and my family and friends not only those who had travelled from far away but also loads at home who are here with us in spirit thank you thank you very much yeah you know yeah yeah finished OK yeah yeah but before i head off please i want to thank the choir very much you touched my heart you know when i wrote thank you to people i i'm hesitant as i said last night because you know i've been raised in english schools and the word love is now say something that you say la la la loosely but in my language it's quite common to say alpha on which means you know i send you my love and i sent it without apologies but with great gratitude truly recognition that you've given not only by the beautiful reception for me and my party and my family but also for the singing that recognizes you know our country our common values but also the people who compose those songs there was a beautiful rapport between you and these people and that led me to the university and maybe let led as well in a very specific way to tonight thank you very much your highness we all share the profound sense of honour in being with you and your family today i call upon professor anthony lang of the school of international relations vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen friends and graduates i'm honored to stand before you today on this momentous occasion first and most importantly to you graduates congratulations you've worked hard here at saint andrews and you should be proud of what you have achieved but what exactly is that achievement what have you gained from all your hard work in the few minutes i have with you today i want to suggest that you now have something special you have authority as you know authority today is under attack political leaders seem incapable of actually doing anything with their authority and when they do use it their efforts too often devolve into assertions of power or even violence even the authority that comes with knowledge is now dismissed by politicians who claim that the people have had enough of experts so what is authority well political theorists distinguish between two kinds the first derives from being appointed or elected to a position in which you govern others which we can call practical authority the second derives from knowledge or skills that enable you to inform and educate others which we can call theoretical authority and if i may as an aside we're lucky to have with us someone who seems to embody both forms in our honorary graduate today you graduates might well attain positions of practical authority in your lives i'm sure we have many here will go on to be leaders in the world of politics but the university in awarding you a degree is not giving you that kind of authority rather the university is signifying that you have the second kind of authority the theoretical kind now for those of you with degrees in international relations this kind of authority can be a challenge at times everyone is entitled to and even encouraged to have views and ideas about our shared political life this is what it means to be a citizen but that is where the difficulty comes in for those of us who study politics do we somehow know more than other citizens now i'm sure you've all had conversations at a family party with that uncle or aunt or cousin or even mom and dad who are sitting behind you today who are ready to debate with you on any and every political point you make when i go to america to see my own father i have exactly these kinds of conversations especially when he makes me sit and watch fox news with him it is those situations where you need to think carefully about your authority in response to those family members you could simply assert that you're a graduate of saint andrews or a professor at saint andrews and so that family member just has to listen to you but well believe me that doesn't work very well my father doesn't really respond when i simply assert my professorial authority so what gives us our authority your authority along with graduates from all the schools and departments is in this university begins with the facts for our students that might include facts about terrorist attacks military interventions international organizations international law or the political and economic systems of various countries around the world but that factual knowledge alone is not what gives you your authority your authority comes i would say from three ways of seeing the world first you you have learned i hope that facts need to be interpreted interpretation means organizing facts within theoretical frameworks thinking critically about those frameworks and exploring how facts become political realities the second basis of your authority comes from putting facts in dialogue with normative standards that is you have come to learn i hope that politics is not simply about the way the world is it is also about the way the world should be and those standards are not just subjective feelings instead they result from deliberative efforts to advance ideas in a complicated world ones that are not true due to their correspondence with facts alone but due to their logic coherence and feasibility the third basis of your authority means thinking about politics globally a graduate from other universities in this country are in much of the world might study the politics of a single country or a single region in fact most people focus primarily on the politics of the country in which they attend university you come from a school of international relations that forces you to think globally to understand not just your own country but other countries in the politics that takes place between around above and beneath them as i hope you have learned there is no way to understand politics today unless you understand it globally so your theoretical authority relies on more than just knowing facts about the world there are too many people today who believe just getting the facts right is the answer to our political problems getting the facts right is indeed the first step but if that is your only criterion for understanding the political world then politics becomes a matter of factual battles in which labeling an opponents views as fake news can become a way to dismiss the other side the study of politics has to be about more than just the facts those of you who can interpret evaluate and locate those facts in a global order have something others do not your theoretical authority comes from your ability to see the political world as more than just the facts and finally of course with your response with your authority comes a responsibility your responsibility is not to assert your authority in a crass and domineering way we see this kind of politics far too often it is to publicly think deliberate and advocate for ideas that are based in fact interpreted through theories evaluated through standards and placed in a global context if you can do this in the years to come i will be proud to say we have given you an authority you deserve and which you can use to make our share world shared world a better place thank you please stand for the benediction grazia

status he was fortunate to be born into a family who recognised that such privileges carry heavy responsibilities to cultural custodianship and duties to political leadership two year tours grandfather challenged colonialism's grip on samoa and his father was amongst those guiding the country to independence in 1962 and he shared the duty of being samoa's first head of state alongside these genealogical connections to some of the most paramount and royal families in samoa two year tours family are also connected to sweden the united states and scotland when robert lewis stevenson settled down in samoa in 1890 he became great friends with tuya tours great grandparents two year tours great grandmother spoke with a scots brogue acquired through her two teenage schooling here his great grandfather sold stephenson the hilltop vailima estate reportedly for a stiff price where the scottish writer known locally as tusitala the teller of tales built a house lived well and is now buried two year tours many customary titles carry the achievements of his forebears yet he has honoured added to and grown these names and knowledges through a life devoted to political service and through his outstanding achievements and contributions to cultural custodianship and to academic scholarship which we are honouring today from 1976 to 1982 two year tua served two terms as prime minister and from 2007 to 2017 he served two terms as head of state disturbed by the growing forces of globalization and the waning relevance of samoan customary knowledge and language in the 1970s two year tour was encouraged by his wife her highness massie offo filifolia IMO tamasese to do something about it by writing a book in the samoan language two year tour has subsequently written several more books dozens of scholarly articles and keynote addresses bringing some on customary knowledge to international audiences his topics have covered climate change specific leadership fragrance cultural taboos political discourse traditional navigation and bioethics his highness is highly respected as one of the four most experts on samoan language culture and philosophy he is renowned across the pacific region as a leading voice on finding pacific ways to decolonize the thinking behind the social economic and environmental effects of a globalizing world in the 1980s in the late 1980s two year tour was part of the south commission whose report the challenge to the south sought to upgrade the international community by treating developing countries as equals in 2005 toyota tour served as the oceania representative to the pontifical interreligious dialogue commission and he wrote harmony in the samoan indigenous religion finds equivalence and balance in all living things to respect nature is to respect man to respect one's fellow men is to respect oneself respecting the soul is to is to respect the body and mind respecting life is to respect death these scholarly interventions develop a method of using the samoan indigenous reference to engage contemporary issues in doing so to ear tour avoids both reverential adherence to and also unthinking abandonment of samoan heritage aiming to find new ways of living in harmony in our ever changing world toria to a scholarship has been recognised through academic fellowships in several universities in new zealand and australia and has been prominent through international keynote addresses including those at the east west centre in hawaii and the university of the south pacific in fiji to hear to us served as chancellor to the university of the south pacific from 2008 to 9 and was chancellor to the national university of samoa from 2008 to 2013 two year tours method of the samoan indigenous reference creates space for calling out vitally important and detrimental globalised conventions that are otherwise difficult to speak about this method and body of work clearly holds relevance and influence beyond samoa ahead of the UN climate summit in copenhagen in 2009 two year tour used samoan indigenous references to the way fishermen address and bestow honour on a shoal of mackerel who reciprocate by respectfully giving themselves in return to challenge the arrogance and greed of humanity separating itself from and then dominating all other forms of life when samoa hosted the UN conference of small island developing states in two in 2014 toyota tour took the UN secretary general aboard the hokulea a majestic double holed voyaging canoe of the kind pacific islanders had used to explore and settle every island across a third of the earth's surface by the time the university of saint andrews was founded 600 years ago banki moon caught the spirit of samoan indigenous reference in declaring that we are all in the same canoe sailing aboard the earth on a journey through the stars in 2015 in the lead up to the UN climate summit in paris 2 yetur paired his view of climate change from the perspective of fish with a speech to the european union in brussels pointing to a samoan indigenous reference in the refusal of two starlings to break from their enjoyable coupling despite being knocked off their conjugal branch the example warned the international community to maintain its dialogue despite the difficulties in fact it was pacific leadership which catalysed the coalition of high ambition that reached the paris climate agreement two year two is insistence that getting into the global conversation to protect the most beautiful things in life needs the backup of great scholarship is a lesson all of us are celebrating here today vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to cultural custodianship and academic scholarship i

promouvoir curious three in symbolum superti hope moretum impundu madam vice chancellor and principal ladies and gentlemen it is a great honor to receive this award but in truth the honor belongs to my forebears it is they who had gathered and passed on to successive generations like mine the history culture customs and usage which is now ours the most significant challenge for indigenous people all over the globe is how to keep our indigenous knowledges alive and thriving alongside the best in the world when are theologies and philosophies are taken seriously by the top universities in the world there is much to celebrate and be grateful for it is therefore high honor for me to have the work of my forebears recognized by this very esteemed university on behalf of my forebears and my family i want to thank the university of sydney andrews for this special recognition i thank in particular madam vice chancellor and principal professor sally mapstone and the center for pacific studies for the warm support and sponsorship i also acknowledge the loving support of my wife and my family and friends not only those who had travelled from far away but also loads at home who are here with us in spirit thank you thank you very much yeah you know yeah yeah finished OK yeah yeah but before i head off please i want to thank the choir very much you touched my heart you know when i wrote thank you to people i i'm hesitant as i said last night because you know i've been raised in english schools and the word love is now say something that you say la la la loosely but in my language it's quite common to say alpha on which means you know i send you my love and i sent it without apologies but with great gratitude truly recognition that you've given not only by the beautiful reception for me and my party and my family but also for the singing that recognizes you know our country our common values but also the people who compose those songs there was a beautiful rapport between you and these people and that led me to the university and maybe let led as well in a very specific way to tonight thank you very much your highness we all share the profound sense of honour in being with you and your family today i call upon professor anthony lang of the school of international relations vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen friends and graduates i'm honored to stand before you today on this momentous occasion first and most importantly to you graduates congratulations you've worked hard here at saint andrews and you should be proud of what you have achieved but what exactly is that achievement what have you gained from all your hard work in the few minutes i have with you today i want to suggest that you now have something special you have authority as you know authority today is under attack political leaders seem incapable of actually doing anything with their authority and when they do use it their efforts too often devolve into assertions of power or even violence even the authority that comes with knowledge is now dismissed by politicians who claim that the people have had enough of experts so what is authority well political theorists distinguish between two kinds the first derives from being appointed or elected to a position in which you govern others which we can call practical authority the second derives from knowledge or skills that enable you to inform and educate others which we can call theoretical authority and if i may as an aside we're lucky to have with us someone who seems to embody both forms in our honorary graduate today you graduates might well attain positions of practical authority in your lives i'm sure we have many here will go on to be leaders in the world of politics but the university in awarding you a degree is not giving you that kind of authority rather the university is signifying that you have the second kind of authority the theoretical kind now for those of you with degrees in international relations this kind of authority can be a challenge at times everyone is entitled to and even encouraged to have views and ideas about our shared political life this is what it means to be a citizen but that is where the difficulty comes in for those of us who study politics do we somehow know more than other citizens now i'm sure you've all had conversations at a family party with that uncle or aunt or cousin or even mom and dad who are sitting behind you today who are ready to debate with you on any and every political point you make when i go to america to see my own father i have exactly these kinds of conversations especially when he makes me sit and watch fox news with him it is those situations where you need to think carefully about your authority in response to those family members you could simply assert that you're a graduate of saint andrews or a professor at saint andrews and so that family member just has to listen to you but well believe me that doesn't work very well my father doesn't really respond when i simply assert my professorial authority so what gives us our authority your authority along with graduates from all the schools and departments is in this university begins with the facts for our students that might include facts about terrorist attacks military interventions international organizations international law or the political and economic systems of various countries around the world but that factual knowledge alone is not what gives you your authority your authority comes i would say from three ways of seeing the world first you you have learned i hope that facts need to be interpreted interpretation means organizing facts within theoretical frameworks thinking critically about those frameworks and exploring how facts become political realities the second basis of your authority comes from putting facts in dialogue with normative standards that is you have come to learn i hope that politics is not simply about the way the world is it is also about the way the world should be and those standards are not just subjective feelings instead they result from deliberative efforts to advance ideas in a complicated world ones that are not true due to their correspondence with facts alone but due to their logic coherence and feasibility the third basis of your authority means thinking about politics globally a graduate from other universities in this country are in much of the world might study the politics of a single country or a single region in fact most people focus primarily on the politics of the country in which they attend university you come from a school of international relations that forces you to think globally to understand not just your own country but other countries in the politics that takes place between around above and beneath them as i hope you have learned there is no way to understand politics today unless you understand it globally so your theoretical authority relies on more than just knowing facts about the world there are too many people today who believe just getting the facts right is the answer to our political problems getting the facts right is indeed the first step but if that is your only criterion for understanding the political world then politics becomes a matter of factual battles in which labeling an opponents views as fake news can become a way to dismiss the other side the study of politics has to be about more than just the facts those of you who can interpret evaluate and locate those facts in a global order have something others do not your theoretical authority comes from your ability to see the political world as more than just the facts and finally of course with your response with your authority comes a responsibility your responsibility is not to assert your authority in a crass and domineering way we see this kind of politics far too often it is to publicly think deliberate and advocate for ideas that are based in fact interpreted through theories evaluated through standards and placed in a global context if you can do this in the years to come i will be proud to say we have given you an authority you deserve and which you can use to make our share world shared world a better place thank you please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri yesu christie at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen",

      "display": "Good afternoon graduates, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Donald McEwen and I'm the chaplain to the university, and it's my pleasure to welcome you today to this graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. On this exciting day for you. Presiding at today's graduation ceremony as the Vice Chancellor, Professor Sally Mapstone. In a few moments, the academic procession will enter the hall to welcome the academic procession. Members of Saint Salvatore Chapel Choir will lead us in singing the Gaudeamus. Please do join in. The words can be found in your program. At the end of the graduation ceremony, all our new graduates will join the academic procession. Leaving the younger hall and walking along North Street and entering since Avaitors quadrangle through the Archway. To others here, Please wait until all our new graduates have left the hall. Ushers will then show you to the nearest exits outside. You will be directed to the quad where you will be able to join our new graduates. Please ensure that your mobile phone is switched off and please remain seated throughout the ceremony. And if you're taking photographs of of someone on the stage, please don't stand up and spoil the view for someone else. To capture this unique moment, our official photographer will now take a photograph of those graduating today before the ceremony begins. Good afternoon. It's a wonderful day. Let's match it with the wonderful smiles you ready. There you go. Ready here we go, why? Well, again. Thank you. Thank you very much for your attention. I hope you enjoy the graduation ceremony.

Per yesim christum dominum nostrum. Amen. Please be seated. Good afternoon, I am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony. At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of the Sanatos Academicals, scholars become masters. Masters become doctors and people of distinction are honoured. It is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation. The ceremony marks a significant rite of passage, in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation become something that they were not before and that moment is witnessed by everyone here in the hall today. Saint Andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking. Important in all of this is that as we change, we both hold to and refrain the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. At this point I would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate, His Highness Tui Atua? Tupua Tamasese taisi ethy? The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at Masters and doctoral level. We confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin, in accordance with Saint Andrews tradition. We call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolize this, I place upon you this cap. To most though, we simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the breaks or trousers of one of this university's most famous 16th century students, John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and author, amongst other things, of the first blast of the trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women. So I am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this CAP actually had different origins. It was purchased for the doctoral graduation in 1696 as Sir John Arbuthnot, the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. His cap has thus been in use in our graduations since the end of the 17th century. As my colleagues and I processed into the younger hall today, you will have noticed that the academic procession was headed by the universities maces, which now are placed to either side of me and together former collection unrivaled by any university in the world. Maces are effectively scepters or Staffs of office, and thus are symbols of the academic authority of the university. They are an immensely venerable part of academic tradition. Three of our maces are of particular antiquity and importance in 1416, three years after the foundation of the university, the then Dean of Arts expended the princely sum of £5 to Commission a Mace for the Faculty of Arts in the middle of the stand to your left. There were few buildings, no library and scarce teaching materials, so this investment in a Mace communicates much of the power such objects hold. The Canon raw Mace in the middle on your right was produced in the mid 15th century, most probably by a Scottish Goldsmith, and with a view to challenging the preeminence of the arts faculty at the time. The traditions of academic rivalry date back to our very foundation. These two laces were complemented in 1461 by the Saint Salvator's Mace, which is the most elaborate and beautifully wrought of the medieval maces. Today it is on your left closest to me. It was commissioned by Bishop James Kennedy, the founder of Saint Servetas. Our other masters have all been commissioned in the last 75 years, signifying that objects of this nature have continuing symbolic value, allowing us to remain strongly in contact with our history as we add to it. So to return now to today's ceremony. After students are awarded their degrees, members of Saint Salvator's Chapel Choir will perform before we proceed to the conferment of an honorary doctorate on His Highness, followed by the graduation address, which today will be given by Professor Anthony Lang. The ceremony will close with the benediction by the University chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession. Before I conclude these remarks, I would like to welcome our guests from the College of William and Mary in Virginia, who join us today to celebrate the 5th graduating class from our unique and innovative joint degree programme, the BA International Honours, it is a pleasure for our institutions to come together to mark the success of students who have not only been part of our own communities, but who have also strengthened the many links between our universities. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We're delighted that you're here to share the success of our graduates. I hope that this is a memorable and really happy day for all of you.

Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, His Highness 2 year tour to poor tamasese Taisi Effi. After yoga, Toya Toya Tupua Tamasese Taisi Effie was born into the highest reaches of Samoan cultural knowledge and customary status. He was fortunate to be born into a family who recognised that such privileges carry heavy responsibilities to cultural custodianship and duties to political leadership. Two year tours, Grandfather challenged Colonialism's grip on Samoa and his father was amongst those guiding the country to independence in 1962, and he shared the duty of being Samoa's first head of state. Alongside these genealogical connections to some of the most paramount and royal families in Samoa, two year tours family are also connected to Sweden, the United States and Scotland. When Robert Lewis Stevenson settled down in Samoa in 1890, he became great friends with tuya tours. Great grandparents. Two year tours. Great grandmother spoke with a Scots brogue. Acquired through her two teenage schooling here. His great grandfather sold Stephenson the Hilltop Vailima estate reportedly for a stiff price where the Scottish writer known locally as Tusitala, the teller of tales, built a house, lived well and is now buried two year tours. Many customary titles carry the achievements of his forebears. Yet he has honoured, added to and grown these names and knowledges through a life devoted to political service and through his outstanding achievements. And contributions to cultural custodianship and to academic scholarship which we are honouring today. From 1976 to 1982, two year Tua served two terms as Prime Minister and from 2007 to 2017 he served two terms as head of state. Disturbed by the growing forces of globalization and the waning relevance of Samoan customary knowledge and language in the 1970s, two year tour was encouraged by his wife, Her Highness Massie Offo Filifolia IMO Tamasese to do something about it by writing a book in the Samoan language. Two year tour has subsequently written several more books, dozens of scholarly articles and keynote addresses, bringing some on customary knowledge to international audiences. His topics have covered climate change, specific leadership, fragrance, cultural taboos, political discourse, traditional navigation, and bioethics. His Highness is highly respected as one of the four most experts on Samoan language, culture and philosophy. He is renowned across the Pacific region as a leading voice on finding Pacific ways to decolonize the thinking behind the social, economic and environmental effects of a globalizing world. In the 1980s, in the late 1980s, two year tour was part of the South Commission, whose report the challenge to the South, sought to upgrade the international community by treating developing countries as equals. In 2005, Toyota Tour served as the Oceania representative to the Pontifical Interreligious Dialogue Commission and he wrote harmony in the Samoan indigenous religion finds. Equivalence and balance in all living things to respect nature is to respect man to respect one's fellow men is to respect oneself respecting the soul is to is to respect the body and mind. Respecting life is to respect death. These scholarly interventions develop a method of using the Samoan indigenous reference to engage contemporary issues in doing so to ear tour avoids both reverential adherence to and also unthinking abandonment of Samoan heritage aiming to find new ways of living in harmony in our ever changing world. Toria to a scholarship has been recognised through academic fellowships. In several universities in New Zealand and Australia, and has been prominent through international keynote addresses, including those at the East West Centre in Hawaii and the University of the South Pacific in Fiji. To hear to us served as Chancellor to the University of the South Pacific from 2008 to 9 and was Chancellor to the National University of Samoa from 2008 to 2013. Two year tours. Method of the Samoan indigenous reference creates space for calling out vitally important and detrimental globalised conventions that are otherwise difficult to speak about. This method and body of work clearly holds relevance and influence beyond Samoa ahead of the UN Climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009. Two year tour. Used Samoan indigenous references to the way fishermen address and bestow honour on a Shoal of mackerel, who reciprocate by respectfully giving themselves in return to challenge the arrogance and greed. Of humanity separating itself from and then dominating all other forms of life. When Samoa hosted the UN Conference of Small Island developing states in two in 2014, Toyota Tour took the UN Secretary general aboard the Hokulea, a majestic double holed voyaging canoe of the kind Pacific Islanders had used to explore and settle every island across a third of the Earth's surface. By the time the University of Saint Andrews was founded. 600 years ago. Banki Moon caught the spirit of Samoan indigenous reference in declaring that we are all in the same canoe, sailing aboard the earth on a journey through the stars. In 2015, in the lead up to the UN Climate summit in Paris, 2 Yetur paired his view of climate change from the perspective of fish with a speech to the European Union in Brussels, pointing to a Samoan indigenous reference. In the refusal of two starlings to break from their enjoyable coupling. Despite being knocked off their conjugal branch, the example warned the international community to maintain its dialogue despite the difficulties. In fact, it was Pacific leadership which catalysed the coalition of high ambition that reached the Paris climate agreement. Two year, two is insistence that getting into the global conversation to protect the most beautiful things in life needs the backup of great scholarship. Is a lesson all of us are celebrating here today. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to cultural custodianship and academic scholarship. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa on His Highness Tuya Tuya Tupua, Tamasese, Taisi, Effie. We can clap a bit more later. Tay and Graham Doctoris litteram honores cowser promouvoir curious three in Symbolum superti hope moretum impundu. Madam, Vice Chancellor and principal, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to receive this award. But in truth, the honor belongs to my forebears. It is they who had gathered and passed on to successive generations like mine. The history, culture, customs and usage which is now ours. The most significant challenge for indigenous people all over the globe is how to keep our indigenous knowledges alive and thriving alongside the best in the world. When are theologies and philosophies are taken seriously by the top universities in the world? There is much to celebrate and be grateful for. It is therefore high honor for me to have the work of my forebears recognized by this very esteemed university. On behalf of my forebears and my family, I want to thank the University of Sydney Andrews for this special recognition. I thank in particular Madam Vice Chancellor and principal. Professor Sally Mapstone and the Center for Pacific Studies for the warm support and sponsorship. I also acknowledge the loving support of my wife and my family and friends, not only those who had travelled from far away but also loads at home. Who are here with us in spirit. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah. You know? Yeah, yeah finished OK. Yeah yeah, but before I head off please I want to thank the choir very much. You touched my heart. You know, when I wrote, thank you to people I I'm hesitant. As I said last night because, you know, I've been raised in English schools and the word love is now say something that you say La La la loosely. But in my language it's quite common to say alpha. On which means you know I send you my love and I sent it without apologies, but with great gratitude, truly recognition that you've given not only by the beautiful reception for me and my party and my family, but also for the singing that recognizes you know our country, our common values, but also the people who compose those songs. There was a beautiful rapport. Between you and these people, and that led me to the university and maybe let led as well in a very specific way to tonight. Thank you very much. Your Highness, we all share the profound sense of honour in being with you and your family today. I call upon Professor Anthony Lang of the School of International Relations. Vice Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen. Friends and graduates. I'm honored to stand before you today on this momentous occasion. First and most importantly to you graduates. Congratulations, you've worked hard here at Saint Andrews, and you should be proud of what you have achieved. But what exactly is that achievement? What have you gained from all your hard work in the few minutes I have with you today? I want to suggest that you now have something special you have authority. As you know, authority today is under attack. Political leaders seem incapable of actually doing anything with their authority, and when they do use it, their efforts too often devolve into assertions of power or even violence. Even the authority that comes with knowledge is now dismissed by politicians who claim that the people have had enough of experts. So what is authority? Well, political theorists distinguish between two kinds. The first derives from being appointed or elected to a position in which you govern others. Which we can call practical authority. The second derives from knowledge or skills that enable you to inform and educate others, which we can call theoretical authority. And if I may, as an aside, we're lucky to have with us someone who seems to embody both forms in our honorary graduate today. You graduates might well attain positions of practical authority in your lives. I'm sure we have many. Here will go on to be leaders in the world of politics, but the university in awarding you a degree is not giving you that kind of authority. Rather, the university is signifying that you have the second kind of authority, the theoretical kind. Now for those of you with degrees in international relations, this kind of authority can be a challenge at times. Everyone is entitled to and even encouraged to have views and ideas about our shared political life. This is what it means to be a citizen. But that is where the difficulty comes in. For those of us who study politics, do we somehow know more than other citizens? Now, I'm sure you've all had conversations at a family party with that uncle or aunt or cousin, or even mom and dad who are sitting behind you today who are ready to debate with you on any and every political point you make. When I go to America to see my own father, I have exactly these kinds of conversations, especially when he makes me sit and watch Fox News with him. It is those situations where you need to think carefully about your authority in response to those family members. You could simply assert that you're a graduate of Saint Andrews or a professor at Saint Andrews, and so that family member just has to listen to you. But well, believe me, that doesn't work very well. My father doesn't really respond when I simply assert my professorial authority. So what gives us our authority? Your authority, along with graduates from all the schools and departments? Is in this university begins with the facts for our students that might include facts about terrorist attacks, military interventions, international organizations, international law, or the political and economic systems of various countries around the world. But that factual knowledge alone is not what gives you your authority. Your authority comes. I would say, from three ways of seeing the world. First you you have learned, I hope that facts need to be interpreted. Interpretation means organizing facts within theoretical frameworks. Thinking critically about those frameworks and exploring how facts become political realities. The second basis of your authority comes from putting facts in dialogue with normative standards. That is, you have come to learn. I hope that politics is not simply about the way the world is. It is also about the way the world should be, and those standards are not just subjective feelings, instead they result from deliberative efforts to advance ideas. In a complicated world, ones that are not true due to their correspondence with facts alone, but due to their logic, coherence, and feasibility. The third basis of your authority means thinking about politics globally. A graduate from other universities in this country are in much of the world, might study the politics of a single country or a single region. In fact, most people focus primarily on the politics of the country in which they attend university. You come from a school of international relations that forces you to think globally, to understand not just your own country, but other countries in the politics that takes place between around, above and beneath them. As I hope you have learned, there is no way to understand politics today unless you understand it globally. So your theoretical authority relies on more than just knowing facts about the world. There are too many people today who believe just getting the facts right is the answer to our political problems. Getting the facts right is indeed the first step, but if that is your only criterion for understanding the political world, then politics becomes a matter of factual battles in which labeling an opponents views as fake news can become a way to dismiss the other side. The study of politics has to be about more than just the facts. Those of you who can interpret, evaluate, and locate those facts in a global order have something others do not. Your theoretical authority comes from your ability to see the political world as more than just the facts. And finally, of course, with your response with your authority comes a responsibility. Your responsibility is not to assert your authority in a crass and domineering way. We see this kind of politics far too often. It is to publicly think deliberate and advocate for ideas that are based in fact interpreted through theories evaluated through standards and placed in a global context. If you can do this in the years to come. I will be proud to say we have given you an authority you deserve and which you can use to make our share world shared world a better place. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Grazia Domini Nostri Yesu Christie at Caritas Day at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen."
