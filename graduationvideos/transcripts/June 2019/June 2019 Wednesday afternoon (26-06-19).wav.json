years ago with a gift from three anonymous donors and is supported by ed and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and road makers in the world the award of the principal 's medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards are open to final year undergraduates and to postgraduates in any discipline the achievements celebrated are academic as well as sporting musical or other attainments for the academic year two thousand and eighteen to nineteen the principal 's medal is being presented to three outstanding students this afternoon we recognise daria savannah fitch who has just received her bachelor of science in computer science daria 's nomination references an outstanding work ethic with her tutor applauding her constant improvement and underlying perseverance to strive to be the best she can be very much in the spirit of our university motto ever to excel darius academic achievements have been consistently exceptional and she has been placed on the dean 's list for every year of her studies i'm delighted to note that she's been awarded first daria 's remarkable comprehension of machine intelligence has also been recognised externally outside of her academic work daria has completed two competitive internships with google within the past two years and has secured a third placement with the company this summer in her three time daria is also a participant in hackathons competitions in which computer programming students compete against each other to challenge their creativity and programming knowledge it should come as no surprise that area 's team has achieved first place in the annual saint andrews hackathon stacks hack for the past two years on the first occasion daria and her team designed a functioning programme for amazon 's alexa and in the second instance they created an app with the function of visualizing a user 's personality from a single paragraph of their text alongside these personal successes daria has consistently demonstrated what her tutor describes as a commitment to improving the lives of others she has volunteered as a mentor for incoming students in the school of computer science for over two years while also delivering top quality work for the school 's internal data management system project nomad where she has been praised as one of the best team members it has seen since its inception daria has supported of female colleagues in particular by teaching with code first girls an initiative dedicated to closing the gender skills gap in technology by improving programming literacy amongst women i quite agree with her tutor when he wrote that computer science is a field in need of female role models like daria daria in recognition of all that you have achieved both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate and as you prepare to start a postgraduate degree in computer science at the university of cambridge it gives me great pleasure to invite you to join me on stage now to receive your medal umm we are aye joy moment bye done the high shady knowing that i on the rain one of the whole from aye barbara amazon i call upon professor catherine hawley of the school of philosophical anthropological and film studies vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science and always kauser professor dame elizabeth naka anyanwu daniel elizabeth is now emeritus professor of nursing at the university of west london following a very distinguished career as nurse health visitor researcher teacher and activist as a health visitor in nineteen seventies london dame elizabeth realized that ethnic minority families were not getting the healthcare they deserved during the same period she discovered her extended family in nigeria and she encountered anti racism campaigners both in the US and in britain this combination of professional personal and political factors prompted daniel elizabeth to focus her energies on sickle cell disease an inheritable blood disorder which can cause severe pain anemia and other major problems if it is not properly treated the disease is especially common in people of nigerian descent but it receives scandalously little attention at the time sufferers including young children often did not even receive proper pain relief in nineteen seventy nine dame elizabeth set up the first ever UK sickle cell balance semia nurse counselling service and she later did groundbreaking research in this area with an emphasis on community support and care for patients and their families in nineteen eighty eight she and a PHD from the institute of education in london a PHD is always an impressive achievement as some of you now know from personal experience but especially so for someone who had left school at sixteen during the nineteen nineties dame elizabeth was at the forefront in teaching and researching nursing ethical and policy issues around genetic disorders first at the institute of child health ben as dean of the school of adult nursing and professor of nursing at the university of west london when she was one of only a handful of black female professors in the whole country in any discipline with professor carl atkins she come off at an important book the politics of sickle cell and palestinia and in nineteen ninety nine she founded the mary seacole centre for nursing practice integrating a multiethnic philosophy into nursing and midwifery midwifery mary seacole was a nineteenth century nurse of jamaican scottish heritage who worked in both central america and the crimea for decades she had remained an obscure historical figure but in recent years she's been increasingly recognized thanks not least to elizabeth anyanwu and her campaigning and fundraising work and memorial statue of mary seacole was finally unveiled at saint thomas 's hospital in london in june twenty sixteen and dame elizabeth is now life patron of the mary seacole trust in twenty seventeen professor anyanwu became dame elizabeth when she was awarded a DBE in the queen 's new year's honours list for services to nursing and to the mary seacole statue appeal this is just one highlight amongst many rewards and recognition in twenty eighteen she was named as one of them of seventy most influential nurses in the history of the NHS she's received the UK chief nursing officer 's lifetime achievement award she's a fellow of the queen 's nursing institute she's a fellow of the royal college of nursing and she's now just moments away from becoming an honorary graduate of the university of saint andrews over her long career dame elizabeth has had immeasurable impact on patients families and communities on generations of nursing students and the communities they have gone on to serve on academic and public recognition of cultural and ethnic issues and healthcare and of course on awareness of mary seacole 's historical significance now retired she's not taking things easy her fascinating memoir mixed blessings from the cambridge union was published in twenty sixteen and she has a full schedule of public talks we know from personal experience here at saint andrews that she's an inspiring generous speaker reflecting on both her professional and her personal experiences vice chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to nursing research and campaigning i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science and norris kauser on professor dame elizabeth naker and yondu tay at gradam tourist cnci from over honoris causa gay and symbolum superette hook brayton imponer first chancellor wow i'm really overwhelmed by this honor but firstly i really would like to congratulate all of the graduates today i mean what a glorious day to be celebrating your achievements with your family friends and all those that have supported you through your studies so well done i've discovered a few rituals i don't know how traditional they are some have really surprised me so for example this morning when my friend nina and i we're walking around saint andrews and we went down obviously to look at the sea i couldn't believe my eyes to see some students now graduates jumping into the water and i would really like to do a shout out to those two male graduates whose photo i talk who are will be tweeting that photo at some point over the next twenty four hours congratulations i don't know how you do it but anyway i'd also like to particularly thank thomassen a second year philosophy student here at the university for inviting me last november my very first visit to the university to give a lecture to students and staff it was an incredible visit the sun was also shining so i think you should bring me along a little bit more frequently but it was the hospitality the welcome the very stimulating discussion after the lecture the wonderful dinner overlooking the sea it it was a it was a tremendous visit for me however never in my wildest dreams did i imagine that i would be back at your wonderful fantastic university before i finish i i have to congratulate the university itself have a sort of link you know this six degrees of separation so i'm really stretching it as you heard my memoirs are called mixed blessings from a cambridge union i did not go to cambridge university and so i was really delighted to see that somebody 's managed to create a split a division between oxbridge you must be so proud and you know i i have kept it a secret that i'm getting this award i'm waiting for the university to tweet it and then i will retweet it and to be able to say because you you did receive so much publicity quite rightly for the achievement of coming second hmm above a certain university called oh we will just leave it at that so really that you you need to be hugely proud of yourselves so in conclusion i just want to once again congratulate the graduates because this is as you well know this is your day so enjoy it don't jump into the sea this afternoon please thank you very much i call upon professor william alston of the school of geography and sustainable development vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen and particularly our new graduates everyone today's graduation ceremony marks in so many ways the end of one journey and the beginning of another let me therefore be the first perhaps the second of many to congratulate you all upon the achievements of your graduation what's a great moment and want to treasure in the years ahead what's an extraordinary honour and privilege it is for me having served as head of school to many of you graduating today to be able to share and reflect on these achievements from what's one of our alumni i hope you will agree described as far and away the best university in the world today is a very special day and one for just celebration but i would like to ask you to take a second to look around you and imagine for a moment the courage that has been the staff of these individual journeys our honorary graduates professor anyanwu for example tireless work in support of others touching the lives of many her journey your journey all our journeys require courage consider too for a moment JM barries rectorial address on the theme of courage which was delivered to the red gowns of saint andrews on the third of may nineteen twenty two that's again courage is what you came to saint andrews for to be fair barry did acknowledge scope for some alarums and excursions into college life and i feel confident that many of you graduating today will doubtless have heeded his advice this brings me to a common theme of graduation addresses the successes of today and the responsibilities of tomorrow many probably all of us here would acknowledged our privileged status and yet we share a passion for change our journey if you will i find this a huge comfort as the years go by the knowledge that from this corner of five saint andrews graduates have for over six hundred years carried the sense of responsibility with them across the globe i hope you will wear that particular badge with pride not as a burden but as that staff for the journey ahead of which barry spoke here by way of example is what that same alumnus of ours had to say upon joining the fellowship of the royal society the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence on the occasion of its three hundred and fiftieth anniversary my generation will have to engage with science more fully perhaps than any that has preceded it it will be through science after all that the world will meet and overcome the challenges of climate change food security water scarcity and pandemic disease here the term science is i believe taken from the latin word scientia meaning knowledge i cannot imagine a better advocate for your university of saint andrews degrees i wish each and everyone of you courage to meet and overcome whatever lies ahead today is not only a day for our graduates to celebrate so let me turn my attention to family supporters and friends a truly global thank you on behalf of my colleagues across the university finally graduates have a good celebration stay in touch and have the most wonderful journeys please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi

outstanding work ethic with her tutor applauding her constant improvement and underlying perseverance to strive to be the best she can be very much in the spirit of our university motto ever to excel darius academic achievements have been consistently exceptional and she has been placed on the dean's list for every year of her studies i'm delighted to note that she's been awarded first daria's remarkable comprehension of machine intelligence has also been recognised externally outside of her academic work daria has completed two competitive internships with google within the past two years and has secured a third placement with the company this summer in her three time daria is also a participant in hackathons competitions in which computer programming students compete against each other to challenge their creativity and programming knowledge it should come as no surprise that area's team has achieved first place in the annual saint andrews hackathon stacks hack for the past two

dedicated to closing the gender skills gap in technology by improving programming literacy amongst women i quite agree with her tutor when he wrote that computer science is a field in need of female

present for the degree of doctor of science and always kauser professor dame elizabeth naka anyanwu daniel elizabeth is now emeritus professor of nursing at the university of west london following a very distinguished career as nurse health visitor researcher teacher and activist as a health visitor in 1970s london dame elizabeth realized that ethnic minority families were not getting the healthcare they deserved during the same period she discovered her extended family in nigeria and she encountered anti racism campaigners both in the US and in britain this combination of professional personal and political factors prompted daniel elizabeth to focus her energies on sickle cell disease an inheritable blood disorder which can cause severe pain anemia and other major problems if it is not properly treated the disease is especially common in people of nigerian descent but it receives scandalously little attention at the time sufferers including young children often did not even receive proper pain relief in 1979 dame elizabeth set up the first ever UK sickle cell balance semia nurse counselling service and she later did groundbreaking research in this area with an emphasis on community support and care for patients and their families in 1988 she and a PHD from the institute of education in london a PHD is always an impressive achievement as some of you now know from personal experience but especially so for someone who had left school at 16 during the 1990s dame elizabeth was at the forefront in teaching and researching nursing ethical and policy issues around genetic disorders first at the institute of child health ben as dean of the school of adult nursing and professor of nursing at the university of west london when she was one of only a handful of black female professors in the whole country in any discipline with professor carl atkins she come off at an important book the politics of sickle cell and palestinia and in 1999 she founded the mary seacole centre for nursing practice integrating a multiethnic philosophy into nursing and midwifery midwifery mary seacole was a 19th century nurse of jamaican scottish heritage who worked in both central america and the crimea for decades she had remained an obscure historical figure but in recent years she's been increasingly recognized thanks not least to elizabeth anyanwu and her campaigning and fundraising work and memorial statue of mary seacole was finally unveiled at saint thomas's hospital in london in june 2016 and dame elizabeth is now life patron of the mary seacole trust in 2017 professor anyanwu became dame elizabeth when she was awarded a DBE in the queen's new year's honours list for services to nursing and to the mary seacole statue appeal this is just one highlight amongst many rewards and recognition in 2018 she was named as one of them of 70 most influential nurses in the history of the NHS she's received the UK chief nursing officer's lifetime achievement award she's a fellow of the queen's nursing institute she's a fellow of the royal college of nursing and she's now just moments away from becoming an honorary graduate of the university of saint andrews over her long career dame elizabeth has had immeasurable impact on patients families and communities on generations of nursing students and the communities they have gone on to serve on academic and public recognition of cultural and ethnic issues and healthcare and of course on awareness of mary seacole's historical significance now retired she's not taking things easy her fascinating memoir mixed blessings from the cambridge union was published in 2016 and she has a full schedule of public talks we know from personal experience here at saint andrews that she's an inspiring generous speaker reflecting on both her professional and her personal experiences vice chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to nursing research and campaigning i invite you to

first chancellor wow i'm really overwhelmed by this honor but firstly i really would like to congratulate all of the graduates today i mean what a glorious day to be celebrating your achievements with your family friends and all those that have supported you through your studies so well done i've discovered a few rituals i don't know how traditional they are some have really surprised me so for example this morning when my friend nina and i we're walking around saint andrews and we went down obviously to look at the sea i couldn't believe my eyes to see some students now graduates jumping into the water and i would really like to do a shout out to those two male graduates whose photo i talk who are will be tweeting that photo at some point over the next 24 hours congratulations i don't know how you do it but anyway i'd also like to particularly thank thomassen a second year philosophy student here at the university for inviting me last november my very first visit to the university to give a lecture to students and staff it was an incredible visit the sun was also shining so i think you should bring me along a little bit more frequently but it was the hospitality the welcome the very stimulating discussion after the lecture the wonderful dinner overlooking the sea it it was a it was a tremendous visit for me however never in my wildest dreams did i imagine that i would be back at your wonderful fantastic university before i finish i i have to congratulate the university itself have a sort of link you know this 6 degrees of separation so i'm really stretching it as you heard my memoirs are called mixed blessings from a cambridge union i did not go to cambridge university and so i was really delighted to see that somebody's managed to create a split a division between oxbridge you must be so proud and you know i i have kept it a secret that i'm getting this award i'm waiting for the university to tweet it and then i will retweet it and to be able to say because you you did receive so much publicity quite rightly for the achievement of coming second hmm above a certain university called oh we will just leave it at that so really that you you need to be hugely proud of yourselves so in conclusion i just want to once again congratulate the graduates because this is as you well know this is your day so enjoy it don't jump into the sea this afternoon please thank you very much i call upon professor william alston of the school of geography and sustainable development vice chancellor ladies and gentlemen and particularly our new graduates everyone today's graduation ceremony marks in so many ways the end of 1 journey and the beginning of another let me therefore be the first perhaps the second of many to congratulate you all upon the achievements of your graduation what's a great moment and want to treasure in the years ahead what's an extraordinary honour and privilege it is for me having served as head of school to many of you graduating today to be able to share and reflect on these achievements from what's one of our alumni i hope you will agree described as far and away the best university in the world today is a very special day and one for just celebration but i would like to ask you to take a second to look around you and imagine for a moment the courage that has been the staff of these individual journeys our honorary graduates professor anyanwu for example tireless work in support of others touching the lives of many her journey your journey all our journeys require courage consider too for a moment JM barries rectorial address on the theme of courage which was delivered to the red gowns of saint andrews on the 3rd of may 1922 that's again courage is what you came to saint andrews for to be fair barry did acknowledge scope for some alarums and excursions into college life and i feel confident that many of you graduating today will doubtless have heeded his advice this brings me to a common theme of graduation addresses the successes of today and the responsibilities of tomorrow many probably all of us here would acknowledged our privileged status and yet we share a passion for change our journey if you will i find this a huge comfort as the years go by the knowledge that from this corner of five st andrews graduates have for over 600 years carried the sense of responsibility with them across the globe i hope you will wear that particular badge with pride not as a burden but as that staff for the journey ahead of which barry spoke here by way of example is what that same alumnus of ours had to say upon joining the fellowship of the royal society the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence on the occasion of its 350th anniversary my generation will have to engage with science more fully perhaps than any that has preceded it it will be through science after all that the world will meet and overcome the challenges of climate change food security water scarcity and pandemic disease here the term science is i believe taken from the latin word scientia meaning knowledge i cannot imagine a better advocate for your university of saint andrews degrees i wish each and everyone of you courage to meet and overcome whatever lies ahead today is not only a day for our graduates to celebrate so let me turn my attention to family supporters and friends a truly global thank you on behalf of my colleagues across the university finally graduates have a good celebration stay in touch and have the most wonderful journeys please stand for the benediction

Good afternoon, I am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony. At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of the sonatas, academicals scholars become Masters, masters become doctors and people of distinction are honoured. It is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation. The ceremony marks a significant right of passage, in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation become something that they were not before and that moment is shared by all of us in the hall here today. Saint Andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking. Important in all of this is that as we change, we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something about the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. At this point I would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate Professor, Dame Elizabeth Anyanwu. The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the confirment of degrees at Masters and doctoral level. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin, in accordance with Saint Andrews tradition. We call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though we simply say ET superette meaning, and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the breaks or trousers of one of this university's most famous 16th century students, John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and author, amongst other things, of the first blast of the trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women. So I'm quite relieved to tell you that researchers show that this cap actually had different origins and was purchased in 1696 for the doctoral graduation of Sir John Arbuthnot, the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. He was best known as creator of the memorable character, John Bull, the quintessential Englishman described by Arbuthnot as an honest plain dealing fellow, kolaric. Build and a very inconstant temper. Our Buffalo's cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century. When our university was founded in the 15th century, the Magistra and would be capped with the Barathrum and presented with a ring and an open book. These last two signified that the master was wedded to the task of opening up the secrets of the written word and obliged to share his knowledge. It was to be almost 5 centuries before women were to graduate too, and during that. The graduation ceremony further evolved. The academic dress that we now assume at these ceremonies was largely originated in the Victorian era, but it was devised on good scholarly principles with much referencing back to medieval costumes and the prescribed fashions of the universities of Paris and Cambridge. Acnes, Forbes Blackadder was our first female graduate and had a Master of Arts conferred at a meeting of the sonatas academicas in March 1895. She went on to achieve eminence as a medic and a dermatologist. A year later, a further four women graduated and by 1913 / 1/3 of students were female. Though the student body of the university change swiftly, much remained constant in the graduation ceremony, with women putting on the same black academic gowns as men, though the Latin phrasing in the ceremony was adjusted to include the feminine over the past decades, it has been necessary to update the Latin on several further occasions as new academic subjects have taken root. Finding latting wordings for a degree in computer science and management required particular. Ingenuity. The inclusion of change is a welcome capacity of graduation and the university continues to change today. We are a community of 9000 students rather than a few 100. Whilst we have always been international today, almost half of our students come from out with the UK. Our curricula continue to evolve and new degree programmes continue to challenge our Latin. Graduation registers these changes in the programs our Deans recite and the students whose success they record. But these transformations are situated against ritual tradition and deeply held values. Today, after students are awarded their degrees and the Principal's medal has been presented, members of Saint Servatus Chapel Choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate on Dame Elizabeth, followed by the graduation address, which today will be delivered by Professor William Austin. The ceremony will close with the benediction and the new graduates will join the academic procession. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We are delighted that you are here to share in the success of our graduates. I hope that this is a memorable and really happy day for all of you. Decanus faculty Artis arzum.

I should now like to introduce the principal's medal. This award was inaugurated 10 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by Ed and Ravenscroft, believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and Rd makers in the world. The award of the Principal's Medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at Saint Andrews. The awards are open to final year undergraduates and to postgraduates in any discipline. The achievements celebrated are academic as well as sporting musical or other attainments. For the academic year 2018 to 19, the Principal's medal is being presented to three outstanding students. This afternoon we recognise Daria Savannah Fitch, who has just received her Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Daria's nomination references. An outstanding work ethic with her tutor applauding her constant improvement and underlying perseverance to strive to be the best she can be. Very much in the spirit of our university motto ever to excel, Darius academic achievements have been consistently exceptional, and she has been placed on the Dean's list for every year of her studies. I'm delighted to note that she's been awarded first. Daria's remarkable comprehension of machine intelligence has also been recognised externally, outside of her academic work, Daria has completed two competitive internships with Google within the past two years and has secured a third placement with the company this summer. In her three time, Daria is also a participant in hackathons competitions in which computer programming students compete against each other to challenge their creativity and programming knowledge. It should come as no surprise. That area's team has achieved first place in the annual Saint Andrews Hackathon stacks hack for the past two years. On the 1st occasion, Daria and her team designed a functioning programme for Amazon's Alexa, and in the second instance they created an app with the function of visualizing a user's personality from a single paragraph of their text. Alongside these personal successes, Daria has consistently demonstrated what her tutor describes as a commitment to improving the lives of others. She has volunteered as a mentor for incoming students in the School of Computer Science for over 2 years, while also delivering top quality work for the school's internal data management system Project Nomad, where she has been praised as one of the best team members it has seen since its inception, Daria has supported. Of female colleagues in particular by teaching with code first girls, an initiative dedicated to closing the gender skills gap in technology by improving programming literacy amongst women. I quite agree with her tutor when he wrote that computer science is a field in need of female role models like Daria. Daria, in recognition of all that you have achieved, both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate, and as you prepare to start a postgraduate degree in computer science at the University of Cambridge, it gives me great pleasure to invite you to join me on stage now to receive your medal. Umm? We are. Aye. Joy. Moment. Bye. Done. The high shady knowing that. I. On the rain. One of the whole. From aye Barbara. Amazon. I call upon Professor Catherine Hawley of the School of Philosophical, Anthropological and Film Studies. Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science and always kauser professor Dame Elizabeth Naka Anyanwu. Daniel Elizabeth is now emeritus professor of nursing at the University of West London, following a very distinguished career as nurse health, visitor, researcher, teacher and activist. As a health visitor in 1970s London, Dame Elizabeth realized that ethnic minority families were not getting the healthcare they deserved. During the same. She discovered her extended family in Nigeria and she encountered anti racism campaigners both in the US and in Britain. This combination of professional, personal and political factors prompted Daniel Elizabeth to focus her energies on sickle cell disease. An inheritable blood disorder, which can cause severe pain, anemia and other major problems if it is not properly treated. The disease is especially common in people of Nigerian descent, but it receives scandalously little attention at the time. Sufferers, including young children, often did not even receive proper pain relief. In 1979, Dame Elizabeth set up the first ever UK sickle cell balance semia Nurse counselling service and she later did groundbreaking research in this area with an emphasis on community support and care for patients and their families. In 1988, she and a PhD from the Institute of Education in London, a PhD, is always an impressive achievement, as some of you now know from personal experience, but especially so for someone who had left school at 16 during the 1990s, Dame Elizabeth was at the forefront in teaching and researching nursing ethical and policy issues around genetic disorders. First, at the Institute of Child Health, Ben, as Dean of the School of Adult Nursing and Professor of Nursing at the University of West London. When she was one of only a handful of black female professors in the whole country in any discipline. With Professor Carl Atkins, she come off at an important book, the politics of sickle Cell and Palestinia and in 1999 she founded the Mary Seacole Centre for Nursing Practice, integrating a multiethnic philosophy into nursing and midwifery midwifery. Mary Seacole was a 19th century nurse of Jamaican Scottish heritage who worked in both Central America and the Crimea. For decades she had remained an obscure historical figure, but in recent years she's been increasingly recognized thanks, not least to Elizabeth Anyanwu and her campaigning and fundraising work and memorial statue of Mary Seacole was finally unveiled at Saint Thomas's Hospital in London in June 2016, and Dame Elizabeth is now life patron of the Mary Seacole Trust. In 2017, Professor Anyanwu became Dame Elizabeth when she was awarded a DBE in the Queen's New Year's Honours list for services to nursing and to the Mary Seacole Statue Appeal. This is just one highlight amongst many rewards and recognition. In 2018, she was named as one of them of 70 most influential nurses in the history of the NHS. She's received the UK chief nursing officer's Lifetime Achievement award. She's a fellow of the Queen's Nursing Institute. She's a fellow of the Royal College of Nursing, and she's now just moments away from becoming an honorary graduate of the University of Saint Andrews. Over her long career, Dame Elizabeth has had immeasurable impact on patients, families, and communities. On generations of nursing students and the communities they have gone on to serve on academic and public recognition of cultural and ethnic issues and healthcare, and, of course, on awareness of Mary Seacole's historical significance. Now retired, she's not taking things easy. Her fascinating memoir, mixed blessings from the Cambridge Union, was published in 2016, and she has a full schedule of public talks. We know from personal experience here at Saint Andrews that she's an inspiring, generous speaker reflecting on both her professional and her personal experiences. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of her major contribution to nursing research and campaigning, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science and Norris Kauser on Professor Dame Elizabeth Naker and Yondu. Tay at Gradam tourist cnci from over honoris causa. Gay and symbolum Superette hook Brayton imponer. First chancellor. Wow. I'm really overwhelmed by this honor. But firstly, I really would like to congratulate all of the graduates today. I mean, what a glorious day to be celebrating your achievements with your family, friends and all those that have supported you through your studies. So well done. I've discovered a few rituals. I don't know how traditional they are. Some have really surprised me. So for example, this morning when my friend Nina and I. We're walking around Saint Andrews and we went down obviously to look at the sea. I couldn't believe my eyes to see some students now graduates. Jumping into the water. And I would really like to do a shout out to those two male graduates. Whose photo I talk? Who are will be tweeting that photo at some point over the next 24 hours? Congratulations, I don't know how you do it, but anyway. I'd also like to particularly thank Thomassen a second year philosophy student here at the university. For inviting me last November, my very first visit to the university. To give a lecture to students and staff. It was an incredible visit. The Sun was also shining, so I think you should bring me along a little bit more frequently. But it was the hospitality, the welcome. The very stimulating discussion after the lecture, the wonderful dinner overlooking the sea. It it was a. It was a tremendous. Visit for me, however, never in my wildest dreams did I imagine. That I would be back at your wonderful. Fantastic university. Before I finish, I I have to congratulate the university itself. Have a sort of link you know this? 6 degrees of separation, so I'm really stretching it. As you heard, my memoirs are called mixed blessings from a Cambridge Union. I did not go to Cambridge University and so I. Was really delighted to see that somebody's managed to create a split a division. Between Oxbridge you must be so proud and you know I I have kept it a secret that I'm getting this award. I'm waiting for the university to tweet it and then I will retweet it. And to be able to say because you you did receive so much publicity, quite rightly for the achievement of coming second, hmm. Above a certain university called, oh, we will just leave it at that. So really that you you need to be hugely proud of yourselves. So in conclusion, I just want to once again congratulate the graduates, because this is, as you well know, this is your day, so enjoy it. Don't jump into the sea this afternoon, please. Thank you very much. I call upon Professor William Alston of the School of Geography and Sustainable Development. Vice Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, and particularly our new graduates. Everyone. Today's graduation ceremony marks in so many ways the end of 1 journey and the beginning of another. Let me therefore be the first, perhaps the second of many to congratulate you all upon the achievements of your graduation. What's a great moment and want to treasure in the years ahead? What's an extraordinary honour and privilege? It is for me, having served as head of school to many of you, graduating today, to be able to share and reflect on these achievements. From what's one of our alumni, I hope you will agree. Described as far and away the best university in the world. Today is a very special day and one for just celebration, but I would like to ask you to take a second to look around you and imagine for a moment the courage that has been the staff of these individual journeys. Our honorary graduates professor Anyanwu. For example. Tireless work in support of others. Touching the lives of many. Her journey your journey. All our journeys require courage. Consider too for a moment. JM Barries Rectorial address on the theme of courage. Which was delivered to the red gowns of Saint Andrews on the 3rd of May, 1922. That's again, courage is what you came to Saint Andrews for. To be fair, Barry did acknowledge scope for some alarums and excursions into college life, and I feel confident that many of you graduating today will doubtless have heeded his advice. This brings me to a common theme of graduation addresses. The successes of today, and the responsibilities of tomorrow. Many, probably all of us here would acknowledged our privileged status. And yet we share a passion for change. Our journey if you will. I find this a huge comfort as the years go by. The knowledge that from this corner of five St. Andrews graduates have for over 600 years carried the sense of responsibility with them across the globe. I hope you will wear that particular badge with pride. Not as a burden, but as that staff for the journey ahead of which Barry spoke. Here, by way of example is what that same alumnus of ours had to say upon joining the fellowship of the Royal Society. The oldest scientific Academy in continuous existence. On the occasion of its 350th anniversary. My generation will have to engage with science more fully perhaps, than any that has preceded it. It will be through science after all that the world will meet and overcome the challenges of climate change. Food security, water scarcity. And pandemic disease. Here the term science is, I believe, taken from the Latin word scientia, meaning knowledge. I cannot imagine a better advocate for your University of Saint Andrews degrees. I wish each and everyone of you courage to meet and overcome whatever lies ahead. Today is not only a day for our graduates to celebrate, so let me turn my attention to family supporters and friends. A truly global thank you on behalf of my colleagues across the university. Finally graduates. Have a good celebration. Stay in touch. And have the most wonderful journeys. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas day. At Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen."
