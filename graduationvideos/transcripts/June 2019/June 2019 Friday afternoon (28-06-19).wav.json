delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony at this gathering which officially is a meeting of the sonatas academicals scholars become masters masters become doctors and people of distinction are honoured it is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation the ceremony marks the significant rite of passage in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before and that moment is shared by all of us here in the hall today saint andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation we are proud to be scotland 's first and most ancient university we are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for so i will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony at this point i would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate francis morris the largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the confirment of degrees at masters and doctoral level we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin in accordance with saint andrews tradition we call upon the deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and we then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say ET super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduand this particular cap was long thought to be a pre piece of the bricks or trousers of one of this university 's most famous sixteenth century students john knox the major proponent of the reformation in scotland and author amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women so i am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had quite different origins it was purchased for the doctoral graduation in sixteen ninety six of sir john arbuthnot the celebrated scottish physician and satirist his cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the seventeenth century ask my colleagues and i processed into the younger hall today who will have noted that the academic procession was interspersed by the universities maces which are now placed to either side of the chancellor and together form a collection unrivaled by any university in the world maces are effectively sceptres or staffs of office and thus are symbols of the academic authority of the university they are in immensely venerable parts of academic tradition three of our mases are of particular antiquity and importance in fourteen sixteen three years after the foundation of the university the then dean of arts expended the princely sum of five pounds to commission a mace for the faculty of arts and this is in the middle of the stand to your left there were few buildings no library and scarce teaching materials so this investment in a mace communicates much of the power such objects hold the cannon law maze which is in the middle on your right was produced in the mid fifteenth century most probably by a scottish goldsmith with a view to challenging the preeminence of the arts faculty at the time the traditions of academic rivalry date back to our very foundation these two maces were complemented in fourteen sixty one by the saint salvatore's mace which is the most elaborate and beautifully wrought of the medieval maces today it is on your left closest to the chancellor it was commissioned by bishop james kennedy the founder of saint servitas out of the maces have all been commissioned in the last seventy five years signified that objects of this nature have continuing symbolic symbolic value allowing us to remain strongly in contact with our history as we add to it so to return now to today's ceremony after students are awarded their degrees members of saint saltwaters chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the conferment of an honourary doctorate and francis morris and after that i will return to give the graduation address the ceremony will close with the benediction by the university chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession graduation is the highlight

phillip anderson ravi mill suska nolta aeros absentees doctoris philosophiae renuncio this i call upon professor francis andrews of the school of history chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of letters or norris kauser francis morris the career so far of francis morris has been spent working at the heart of the contemporary art world but not in auction houses watching sky prices art prices sky rocket sky prices rocketing whichever way you want to put it in twenty sixteen she became the director of tate modern the extraordinary gallery on the river thames in london that has done so much to transform the world 's understanding of what modern art is and what it can be how art can challenge ideas and how we might collect the uncollectable france 's history with tate goes way back she joined as a curator in nineteen eighty seven becoming head of displays at tate modern when it opened in two thousand a landmark moment in the history of museums and the part of her career of which she is most proud the famous turbine hall and the new blavatnik building are her everyday her office along the way she has created several land make mark exhibitions including major retrospectives on women artists such as the french american louise bourgeois in two thousand and seven the japanese yayoi kusama in twenty twelve and the canadian born american agnes martin in twenty fifteen these were standout successes but they were also part of building up the representation of women in the collection and internationalising it francis morris has become one of the most respected voices in the arts while also championing diversity in a creative community including women it is clear that francis is pretty passionate about removing borders as she says tate modern is a place where you don't need a visa to walk between beijing and berlin but tate removes other borders too between media where the film sculpture painting or live art and between gender and ethnicity allowing us to celebrate the whole range of creativity as she puts it and also to network globally great art is fueled by conversations between people with diverse positions and types of practice so francis wants tate modern to be a place where there is plenty of powerful art on show but those walking into its spaces feel they can hang out not a gallery where you look and whisper reflect reflect quietly and leave instead a place to experience great art in the context of living life seeing friends having fun anyone who has been there will know that she is succeeding beyond measure francis morris tate modern is an international hub a platform working at the boundaries between the local and the global between physical and virtual contact promoting connections and in touch with the rest of the world if this is not your standard image of an art gallery then it might interest you to know that francis is thinking about borders begins with transgression where borders seem immovable a first step is to transgress them both institutionally and probably more importantly personally whatever anybody tells you about your prospects and skills she says always push a little bit further it's always worth opening the next door or looking round the corner because often the most generative creative and dynamic things actually are on the margins exciting things very often happen slightly out of view francis 's own career has been happening very much in public view since she took over at tate modern but she herself grew up in south london south east london with the national maritime museum at the end of the street and the bethnal green museum of childhood nearby it was in these great public institutions that she learned the power of objects to speak about and to people 's lives she was also drawn very much to history she attended a state secondary school in new cross from where she won a scholarship to cambridge going on to achieve first class honours in history of art followed by a distinction in a master 's degree at the court hold institute in london francis is a great role model and this is not just because she is a woman who has reached the peak of her profession while helping break some of the conventional canons of art history the first exhibition she curated and organised was in the summer of nineteen ninety three focused on avowedly her favorite period in art paris post war it was a major undertaking the work of three years twenty six years later her catalogue is still selling on amazon yet at the time it was not well received reading the press reviews must have been painful as she now says the hostile reception was an experience through which she built resilience to succeed you have to learn to take criticism on the chin no career is without regrets francis loved rotring pens as a child and sometimes wish she had studied art rather than art history but had she made that choice i fear we might not have had the benefit of her leadership at tate modern being director of one of the world 's great contemporary art museums involves a lot of hard work with funding bodies and bureaucrats politicians and the press her directorships so far has coincided with the difficult debates over brexit but she is still working with artists still making exhibitions she's still building the collection through connections still thinking about how we can collect the uncollectable chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to the world of the arts i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters or norris kauser on francis morris terry i'd graham doctoris litteram norris kauser promotio courteous radian symbolum sulfate hobby retirement pono consolations chancellor principal master professor andrews professors graduates distinguished families and friends of graduates this is a truly a great honour francis that was such a wonderful wonderful speech currently to correct you on one point i'm afraid the catalogue and amazon is sold out but there is one copy available on ebay should you wish to participate so i was taught art history at a time when people still spoke of great masters believe that there was a fixed canon of western art and actually felt that this art was intrinsically more important somehow more central and more advanced than what lay beyond but as i made my way in the world after graduation in the nineteen eighties in the wake of the first wave of radical feminism the first post colonial revisionist assaults on history and alongside the beginnings of the new art history my generation began to realise that much that we had been taught much of the value system we had inherited was in fact contingent historically conditioned framed by structures of race gender and class the humanities the arts and sciences the subjects i love those that you have been studying led the way replacing criticism with critical theory contesting values rather than merely confirming them broadening and diversifying our histories taking down those borders i became director of tate modernist francis said just weeks before the brexit vote how ironic it felt to be launching my new career the new tape modern with a brave vision of the interconnectedness of contemporary global cultures of a museum metaphorically without walls just as the people of our four nations voted to withdraw to the periphery of europe how strange and troubling for you students of the arts and sciences to graduate today into this world of seemingly diminishing horizons and flattened perspectives so you're graduating at a time when those values that have underpinned your endeavours here at saint andrews curiosity open mindedness honesty values that universities exist to foster seem especially vulnerable outside these walls at a time when borders of geography wealth race and faith are more present and corrosive than at any time i can remember even so and you can see today you're rightly full of hope john berger the writer and critic of that great book ways of seeing which back in the nineteen seventies shaped my own understanding of culture understood the importance of hope hope berger wrote is not a form of guarantee it's a form of energy and very frequently that energy is strongest in circumstances that are very dark and i've been reminding of reminded of that paradox again and again over recent months and days seeing the work of colleagues across the UK visiting artists studios colleges schools my visit over the last two days to saint andrews witnessing the activities of communities of grassroots organisations of scholars in and around the cities of the UK as they confront both brexit and now imminently and most scarily climate extinction all of us graduates of the arts and sciences have here an extraordinary opportunity how amazing it would be if you if we could rebuild build trust in culture how could we get down from our ivory towers that exit our echo chambers relinquish our exclusive vocabularies and that as i see it is the challenge for you as you leave the university as graduates in moving from thinking outside the box to acting outside the box so break the rules challenge the conventions in the words of my absolutely top favorite artist the great louise bourgeois do undo and redo and if i can collect the uncollectable you can think the unthinkable you can do the undoable and make it happen for you for others and for the world thank you i call upon the principle of the university professor sally mapston graduates congratulations firstly you've made it across the stage those of us who sit here as you do that do understand how preoccupying that is will you hand over your hood properly will you be able to find your way off the stage will you negotiate the kilt or high heels or occasionally both you've chosen to wear for the ceremony well you all have done so well done now you can focus on what all this means your degree is an immensely special achievement it represents something in your life that will stay with you and which you have the right to be very proud of you now have the record in a tradition that has been taking place here since the start of the fifteenth century but you also represent the future of this wonderful university as its members stream out into the modern world to make their mark so again very very many congratulations to all of you from all of us here now in a few minutes you will walk out of this hall into the sunshine and the wide expanse of the summer months now lie ahead of you the summer of twenty nineteen the mild days are yours to treasure and i recommend that you do so with the assuredness of those who've completed a formidable stage in a long journey so one of the things a university career prompts us to do is to use what we know to reexamine it so i invite you as you look forward to the lives and careers that await you to also look back to a summer fifty years ago this year the summer of nineteen sixty nine which remains strong in the popular imagination it was a moment of immense political social and technological upheaval there are reverberations of which we still feel today following waves of national protests this was the summer when the new US president richard nixon began withdrawing troops from vietnam in bethel new york state it was the summer when four hundred thousand people gathered at a farm for a music festival woodstock featuring acts such as jimi hendrix the grateful dead and janice joplin i do hope those names resonate down there that the very resonant up here it was the summer when apollo eleven landed on the moon and neil armstrong proclaimed one small step for man one giant leap for mankind it won't surprise you to know that in the mapstone household as we clustered around a small black and white television that utterance was met with cries of what about women the stonewall riots broke out in new york and the books that everyone was reading were maya angelou 's i know why the caged bird sings or kurt vonnegut 's seminal anti war novel slaughterhouse five it was a summer of dreamers protesters reactionaries dissidents idealists and radicals nineteen sixty nine was memorable in the life of this university too in those days we were a community of a little under two and a half thousand students less than a third of what we are today but we were questioning and ambitious then too and as a result three of our schools art history psychology and computer science are celebrating fiftieth anniversaries this year all of these schools have flourished fifty years of hard work have ideas of brilliant lecturers and professors and ingenious students sometimes of course covering a combination of these three subjects in their studies have created a set of uniquely powerful environments that are recognised as world leading in their fields and i should add in the presence of graduates and colleagues from the school of psychology and neuroscience that the founding chair of psychology appointed in nineteen sixty nine malcolm jeeves is still a distinguished active emeritus professor today and we're proud to host the annual jeeves lecture in his name so the progress made by these schools over these years should prompt us to reflect on the importance of taking bold action and doing new things and equally a following following those actions through with persistence of the next steps that come after the great leap for everybody alongside persistence these next steps often require that we reach out and take others with us and engage an increasingly diverse and informed community in our ambitions that is how real change comes to take shape and have impact and that is what incidentally our university strategy for twenty eighteen to twenty three which so many people in this room have played a part in shaping is all about dreaming protesting and dissenting are important and they have their moments they are equally paths in life long after the summer of nineteen sixty nine we continue to protest against war and discrimination we continue to search for truth in new music and across a range of media and we continue to explore the stars though some of us may complain about the unrelenting need for action wondering when we will ever truly improve or when we will be content i take the opposite view because we continue to strive we continue to succeed so i hope that whilst with us you've learned to listen and then to argue to imagine and to make a fresh case these are the deep skills we aim to enable in you and that is how you can make a difference the road of the radical is a long one and one i recommend to you but precisely because it is a long road you need to make sure you were properly prepared for it and for today that requires fun refueling and photographs so many congratulations again and please do stay in touch with what will always continue to be your university thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti said kumar minibus nobis and secular secularism amen",

the degree of doctor of letters or norris kauser francis morris the career so far of francis morris has been spent working at the heart of the contemporary art world but not in auction houses watching sky prices art prices sky rocket sky prices rocketing whichever way you want to put it in 2016 she became the director of tate modern the extraordinary gallery on the river thames in london that has done so much to transform the world's understanding of what modern art is and what it can be how art can challenge ideas and how we might collect the uncollectable france's history with tate goes way back she joined as a curator in 1987 becoming head of displays at tate modern when it opened in 2000 a landmark moment in the history of museums and the part of her career of which she is most proud the famous turbine hall and the new blavatnik building are her everyday her office along the way she has created several land make mark exhibitions including major retrospectives on women artists such as the french american louise bourgeois in 2007 the japanese yayoi kusama in 2012 and the canadian born american agnes martin in 2015 these were standout successes but they were also part of building up the representation of women in the collection and internationalising it francis morris has become one of the most respected voices in the arts while also championing diversity in a creative community including women it is clear that francis is pretty passionate about removing borders as she says tate modern is a place where you don't need a visa to walk between beijing and berlin but tate removes other borders too between media where the film sculpture painting or live art and between gender and ethnicity allowing us to celebrate the whole range of creativity as she puts it and also to network globally great art is fueled by conversations between people with diverse positions and types of practice so francis wants tate modern to be a place where there is plenty of powerful art on show but those walking into its spaces feel they can hang out not a gallery where you look and whisper reflect reflect quietly and leave instead a place to experience great art in the context of living life seeing friends having fun anyone who has been there will know that she is succeeding beyond measure francis morris tate modern is an international hub a platform working at the boundaries between the local and the global between physical and virtual contact promoting connections and in touch with the rest of the world if this is not your standard image of an art gallery then it might interest you to know that francis is thinking about borders begins with transgression where borders seem immovable a first step is to transgress them both institutionally and probably more importantly personally whatever anybody tells you about your prospects and skills she says always push a little bit further it's always worth opening the next door or looking round the corner because often the most generative creative and dynamic things actually are on the margins exciting things very often happen slightly out of view francis's own career has been happening very much in public view since she took over at tate modern but she herself grew up in south london SE london with the national maritime museum at the end of the street and the bethnal green museum of childhood nearby it was in these great public institutions that she learned the power of objects to speak about and to people's lives she was also drawn very much to history she attended a state secondary school in new cross from where she won a scholarship to cambridge going on to achieve first class honours in history of art followed by a distinction in a master's degree at the court hold institute in london francis is a great role model and this is not just because she is a woman who has reached the peak of her profession while helping break some of the conventional canons of art history the first exhibition she curated and organised was in the summer of 1993 focused on avowedly her favorite period in art paris post war it was a major undertaking the work of three years 26 years later her catalogue is still selling on amazon yet at the time it was not well received reading the press reviews must have been painful as she now says the hostile reception was an experience through which she built resilience to succeed you have to learn to take criticism on the chin no career is without regrets francis loved rotring pens as a child and sometimes wish she had studied art rather than art history but had she made that choice i fear we might not have had the benefit of her leadership at tate modern being director of one of the world's great contemporary art museums involves a lot of hard work with funding bodies and bureaucrats politicians and the press her directorships so far has coincided with the difficult debates over brexit but she is still working with artists still making exhibitions she's still building the collection through connections still thinking about how we can collect the uncollectable chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to the world of the arts i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters or norris kauser on francis morris terry i'd graham doctoris litteram norris kauser promotio courteous radian symbolum sulfate hobby retirement pono consolations chancellor principal master professor andrews professors graduates distinguished families and friends of graduates this is a truly a great honour francis that was such a wonderful wonderful speech currently to correct you on one point i'm afraid the catalogue and amazon is sold out but there is one copy available on ebay should you wish to participate so i was taught art history at a time when people still spoke of great masters believe that there was a fixed canon of western art and actually felt that this art was intrinsically more important somehow more central and more advanced than what lay beyond but as i made my way in the world after graduation in the 1980s in the wake of the first wave of radical feminism the 1st post colonial revisionist assaults on history and alongside the beginnings of the new art history my generation began to realise that much that we had been taught much of the value system we had inherited was in fact contingent historically conditioned framed by structures of race gender and class the humanities the arts and sciences the subjects i love those that you have been studying led the way replacing criticism with critical theory contesting values rather than merely confirming them broadening and diversifying our histories taking down those borders i became director of tate modernist francis said just weeks before the brexit vote how ironic it felt to be launching my new career the new tape modern with a brave vision of the interconnectedness of contemporary global cultures of a museum metaphorically without walls just as the people of our four nations voted to withdraw to the periphery of europe how strange and troubling for you students of the arts and sciences to graduate today into this world of seemingly diminishing horizons and flattened perspectives so you're graduating at a time when those values that have underpinned your endeavours here at saint andrews curiosity open mindedness honesty values that universities exist to foster seem especially vulnerable outside these walls at a time when borders of geography wealth race and faith are more present and corrosive than at any time i can remember even so and you can see today you're rightly full of hope john berger the writer and critic of that great book ways of seeing which back in the 1970s shaped my own understanding of culture understood the importance of hope hope berger wrote is not a form of guarantee it's a form of energy and very frequently that energy is strongest in circumstances that are very dark and i've been reminding of reminded of that paradox again and again over recent months and days seeing the work of colleagues across the UK visiting artists studios colleges schools my visit over the last two days to saint andrews witnessing the activities of communities of grassroots organisations of scholars in and around the cities of the UK as they confront both brexit and now imminently and most scarily climate extinction all of us graduates of the arts and sciences have here an extraordinary opportunity how amazing it would be if you if we could rebuild build trust in culture how could we get down from our ivory towers that exit our echo chambers relinquish our exclusive vocabularies and that as i see it is the challenge for you as you leave the university as graduates in moving from thinking outside the box to acting outside the box so break the rules challenge the conventions in the words of my absolutely top favorite artist the great louise bourgeois do undo and redo and if i can collect the uncollectable you can think the unthinkable you can do the undoable and make it happen for you for others and for the world thank you i call upon the principle of the university professor sally mapston graduates congratulations firstly you've made it across the stage those of us who sit here as you do that do understand how preoccupying that is will you hand over your hood properly will you be able to find your way off the stage will you negotiate the kilt or high heels or occasionally both you've chosen to wear for the ceremony well you all have done so well done now you can focus on what all this means your degree is an immensely special achievement it represents something in your life that will stay with you and which you have the right to be very proud of you now have the record in a tradition that has been taking place here since the start of the 15th century but you also represent the future of this wonderful university as its members stream out into the modern world to make their mark so again very very many congratulations to all of you from all of us here now in a few minutes you will walk out of this hall into the sunshine and the wide expanse of the summer months now lie ahead of you the summer of 2019 the mild days are yours to treasure and i recommend that you do so with the assuredness of those who've completed a formidable stage in a long journey so one of the things a university career prompts us to do is to use what we know to reexamine it so i invite you as you look forward to the lives and careers that await you to also look back to a summer 50 years ago this year the summer of 1969 which remains strong in the popular imagination it was a moment of immense political social and technological upheaval there are reverberations of which we still feel today following waves of national protests this was the summer when the new US president richard nixon began withdrawing troops from vietnam in bethel new york state it was the summer when 400,000 people gathered at a farm for a music festival woodstock featuring acts such as jimi hendrix the grateful dead and janice joplin i do hope those names resonate down there that the very resonant up here it was the summer when apollo 11 landed on the moon and neil armstrong proclaimed one small step for man one giant leap for mankind it won't surprise you to know that in the mapstone household as we clustered around a small black and white television that utterance was met with cries of what about women the stonewall riots broke out in new york and the books that everyone was reading were maya angelou's i know why the caged bird sings or kurt vonnegut's seminal anti war novel slaughterhouse five it was a summer of dreamers protesters reactionaries dissidents idealists and radicals 1969 was memorable in the life of this university too in those days we were a community of a little under two and a half thousand students less than 1/3 of what we are today but we were questioning and ambitious then too and as a result three of our schools art history psychology and computer science are celebrating 50th anniversaries this year all of these schools have flourished 50 years of hard work have ideas of brilliant lecturers and professors and ingenious students sometimes of course covering a combination of these three subjects in their studies have created a set of uniquely powerful environments that are recognised as world leading in their fields and i should add in the presence of graduates and colleagues from the school of psychology and neuroscience that the founding chair of psychology appointed in 1969 malcolm jeeves is still a distinguished active emeritus professor today and we're proud to host the annual jeeves lecture in his name so the progress made by these schools over these years should prompt us to reflect on the importance of taking bold action and doing new things and equally a following following those actions through with persistence of the next steps that come after the great leap for everybody alongside persistence these next steps often require that we reach out and take others with us and engage an increasingly diverse and informed community in our ambitions that is how real change comes to take shape and have impact and that is what incidentally our university strategy for 2018 to 23 which so many people in this room have played a part in shaping is all about dreaming protesting and dissenting are important and they have their moments they are equally paths in life long after the summer of 1969 we continue to protest against war and discrimination we continue to search for truth in new music and across a range of media and we continue to explore the stars though some of us may complain about the unrelenting need for action wondering when we will ever truly improve or when we will be content i take the opposite view because we continue to strive we continue to succeed so i hope that whilst with us you've learned to listen and then to argue to imagine and to make a fresh case these are the deep skills we aim to enable in you and that is how you can make a difference the road of the radical is a long one and one i recommend to you but precisely because it is a long road you need to make sure you were properly prepared for it and for today that requires fun refueling and photographs so many congratulations again and please do stay in touch with what will always continue to be your university thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti said kumar minibus nobis and secular secularism amen",

      "display": "Good afternoon graduates, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Donald McEwen and I'm the chaplain to the university. It is my pleasure to welcome you today to this graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews on this exciting day for you presiding at today's graduation ceremony is the Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem. In a few moments, the academic procession will enter the hall to welcome the academic procession. Members of since Salvatore's Chapel Choir will lead us in singing the Gaudeamus, please do join in. The words can be found in your program. At the end of the graduation ceremony, all our new graduates will join the academic procession, leaving the younger hall walking along North Street and entering. Since Avatars quadrangle through the archway. To supporters here at the end, Please wait until all our new graduates have left the hall. Ushers will then show you to the nearest exits and outside you'll you will be directed to the quad where you will be able to join our new graduates. Please ensure that your mobile phone is switched off and please remain seated throughout the ceremony and even when you're taking photographs of people who are here to capture this unique moment now our official photographer will take a photograph of those graduating today before the ceremony begins. Good afternoon. Psychologist day. So let's see a gorgeous smiles. You like that you ready? Here we go. Come on. That is wonderful. Thank you. Thank you very much for your attention.

PS At Party equipped Tum Phineas Tur Cotinus, Sanctum nomen tuum glorificus at Misericordia. Tua Vitam iterm consumer per yessum christum dominum nostrum, Amen. Please be seated. I call upon the principle of the university. Good afternoon. I am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony. At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of the sonatas, academicals scholars become Masters, masters become doctors and people of distinction are honoured. It is the major celebratory occasion in our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation. The ceremony marks the significant rite of passage, in particular for our students who in the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before, and that moment is shared by all of us. Here in the hall today. Saint Andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking. Important in all of this is that as we change, we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. At this point I would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate, Francis Morris. The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the confirment of degrees at Masters and doctoral level. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin, in accordance with Saint Andrews tradition. We call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though we simply say ET, super Tay meaning, and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduand. This particular cap was long thought to be a pre piece of the bricks or trousers of one of this university's most famous 16th century students, John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and author, amongst other things, of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous. Regiment of women. So I am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this CAP actually had quite different origins. It was purchased for the doctoral graduation in 1696 of Sir John Arbuthnot, the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. His cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century. Ask my colleagues and I processed into the younger hall today who will have noted that the academic procession was interspersed by the universities maces which are now placed to either side of the Chancellor and together form a collection unrivaled by any university in the world. Maces are effectively sceptres or Staffs of office, and thus are symbols of the academic authority of the university. They are in immensely. Venerable parts of academic tradition. Three of our mases are of particular antiquity and importance. In 1416, three years after the foundation of the university, the then Dean of Arts expended the princely sum of £5 to Commission a Mace for the Faculty of Arts, and this is in the middle of the stand to your left. There were few buildings, no library and scarce teaching materials, so this investment in a Mace communicates much of the power such objects hold. The Cannon law maze, which is in the middle on your right. Was produced in the mid 15th century, most probably by a Scottish Goldsmith with a view to challenging the preeminence of the arts faculty at the time. The traditions of academic rivalry date back to our very foundation. These two maces were complemented in 1461 by the Saint Salvatore's Mace, which is the most elaborate and beautifully wrought of the medieval maces. Today it is on your left closest to the Chancellor. It was commissioned by Bishop James Kennedy, the founder of Saint Servitas. Out of the maces have all been commissioned in the last 75 years signified that objects of this nature have continuing symbolic symbolic value, allowing us to remain strongly in contact with our history as we add to it. So to return now to today's ceremony, after students are awarded their degrees, members of Saint Saltwaters Chapel Choir will perform before we proceed to the conferment of an honourary doctorate. And Francis Morris. And after that I will return to give the graduation address. The ceremony will close with the benediction by the University chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We're delighted that you are all here to share in the success of our graduates. I hope this is a memorable and really happy day for all of you. Decanus facultas artium chancellor.

I call upon Professor Francis Andrews of the School of History. Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters or Norris Kauser, Francis Morris. The career so far of Francis Morris has been spent working at the heart of the contemporary art world, but not in auction houses. Watching sky prices, art prices, sky rocket sky prices rocketing whichever way you want to put it. In 2016, she became the director of Tate Modern, the Extraordinary Gallery on the River Thames in London that has done so much to transform the world's understanding. Of what modern art is and what it can be. How art can challenge ideas and how we might collect the uncollectable. France's history with Tate goes way back. She joined as a curator in 1987, becoming head of displays at Tate Modern when it opened in 2000, a landmark moment in the history of museums and the part of her career of which she is most proud. The famous turbine hall and the new Blavatnik Building are her everyday her office. Along the way, she has created several land make mark exhibitions, including major retrospectives on women artists such as the French American Louise Bourgeois. In 2007 the Japanese Yayoi Kusama in 2012, and the Canadian born American Agnes Martin in 2015. These were standout successes, but they were also part of building up the representation of women. In the collection and internationalising it, Francis Morris has become one of the most respected voices in the arts, while also championing diversity in a creative community including women. It is clear that Francis is pretty passionate about removing borders. As she says, Tate Modern is a place where you don't need a visa to walk between Beijing and Berlin. But Tate removes other borders too, between media, where the film, sculpture, painting, or live art and between gender and ethnicity, allowing us to celebrate the whole range of creativity as she puts it. And also to network globally. Great art is fueled by conversations between people with diverse positions and types of practice. So Francis wants Tate Modern to be a place where there is plenty of powerful art on show, but those walking into its spaces feel they can hang out, not a gallery where you look and whisper, reflect, reflect, quietly and leave instead a place to experience great art in the context of living life, seeing friends, having fun, anyone who has been there will know that she is succeeding beyond measure. Francis Morris Tate Modern is an international hub, a platform working at the boundaries between the local and the global between physical and virtual contact, promoting connections and in touch with the rest of the world. If this is not your standard image of an art gallery, then it might interest you to know that Francis is thinking about borders, begins with transgression. Where borders seem immovable, a first step is to transgress them both institutionally and probably more importantly, personally. Whatever anybody tells you about your prospects and skills, she says, always push a little bit further. It's always worth opening the next door or looking round the corner because often the most generative, creative and dynamic things actually are on the margins. Exciting things very often happen, slightly out of view. Francis's own career has been happening very much in public view since she took over at Tate Modern, but she herself grew up in South London, SE London with the National Maritime Museum. At the end of the street and the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood nearby. It was in these great public institutions that she learned the power of objects to speak about and to people's lives. She was also drawn very much to history. She attended a state secondary school in New Cross from where she won a scholarship to Cambridge going on to achieve First Class honours in history of art, followed by a distinction in a master's degree at the Court hold Institute in London. Francis is a great role model and this is not just because she is a woman who has reached the peak of her profession while helping break some of the conventional canons of art history. The first exhibition she curated and organised was in the summer of 1993. Focused on avowedly. Her favorite. In Art, Paris Post War. It was a major undertaking. The work of three years. 26 years later, her catalogue is still selling on Amazon. Yet at the time it was not well received. Reading the press reviews must have been painful. As she now says, the hostile reception was an experience through which she built resilience. To succeed, you have to learn to take criticism on the chin. No career is without regrets. Francis loved Rotring pens as a child and sometimes wish she had studied art rather than art history. But had she made that choice, I fear we might not have had the benefit of her leadership at Tate Modern. Being director of one of the world's great contemporary art museums involves a lot of hard work with funding bodies and bureaucrats, politicians, and the press. Her directorships so far has coincided with the difficult debates over Brexit, but she is still working with artists still making exhibitions. She's still building the collection through connections, still thinking about how we can collect the uncollectable Chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to the world of the arts. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters or Norris Kauser on Francis Morris. Terry, I'd, Graham, Doctoris, Litteram Norris, Kauser promotio courteous, Radian symbolum sulfate hobby retirement Pono. Consolations. Chancellor principal master Professor Andrews professors, graduates, distinguished families and friends of graduates. This is a truly a great honour. Francis that was such a wonderful, wonderful speech. Currently to correct you on one point, I'm afraid the catalogue and Amazon is sold out. But there is one copy available on eBay. Should you wish to participate? So I was taught art history at a time when people still spoke of great Masters. Believe that there was a fixed Canon of Western art and actually felt that this art was intrinsically more important, somehow more central and more advanced than what lay beyond. But as I made my way in the world after graduation in the 1980s, in the wake of the first wave of radical feminism, the 1st post colonial revisionist assaults on history. And alongside the beginnings of the new art history, my generation began to realise that much that we had been taught much of the value system we had inherited was in fact contingent historically conditioned, framed by structures of race, gender and class. The humanities, the Arts and Sciences. The subjects. I love those that you have been studying, led the way replacing criticism with critical theory, contesting values rather than merely confirming them. Broadening and diversifying our histories, taking down those borders. I became director of Tate Modernist. Francis said just weeks before the Brexit vote. How ironic it felt to be launching my new career. The new tape modern with a brave vision of the interconnectedness of contemporary global cultures of a museum. Metaphorically without walls. Just as the people of our Four Nations voted to withdraw to the periphery of Europe, how strange and troubling for you students of the Arts and Sciences to graduate today. Into this world of seemingly diminishing horizons and flattened perspectives. So you're graduating at a time when those values that have underpinned your endeavours here at Saint Andrews Curiosity, open mindedness. Honesty. Values that universities exist to foster seem especially vulnerable outside these walls. At a time when borders. Of geography, wealth, race and faith are more present and corrosive than at any time I can remember. Even so, and you can see today you're rightly full of hope. John Berger, the writer and critic of that great book, Ways of Seeing which back in the 1970s shaped my own understanding of culture, understood the importance of hope. Hope, Berger wrote, is not a form of guarantee. It's a form of energy and very frequently that energy is strongest in circumstances that are very dark. And I've been reminding of reminded of that paradox again and again over recent months and days. Seeing the work of colleagues across the UK, Visiting Artists, Studios, colleges, schools, my visit over the last two days to Saint Andrews, witnessing the activities of communities of grassroots organisations, of scholars in and around the cities of the UK as they confront both Brexit and now imminently and most scarily climate extinction. All of us graduates of the Arts and Sciences have here an extraordinary opportunity. How amazing it would be if you if we could rebuild, build trust in culture. How could we get down from our ivory towers that exit our echo? Chambers relinquish our exclusive vocabularies and that as I see it is the challenge for you as you leave the university as graduates in moving from thinking outside the box. To acting outside the box, so break the rules. Challenge the conventions in the words of my absolutely top favorite artist, the Great Louise Bourgeois, do undo and redo, and if I can collect the uncollectable, you can think the unthinkable. You can do the undoable and make it happen for you, for others and for the world. Thank you. I call upon the principle of the university Professor Sally Mapston. Graduates. Congratulations, firstly, you've made it across the stage. Those of us who sit here as you do that do understand how preoccupying that is. Will you hand over your hood properly? Will you be able to find your way off the stage? Will you negotiate the kilt or high heels, or occasionally both you've chosen to wear for the ceremony? Well you all have done so. Well done. Now you can focus on what all this means. Your degree is an immensely special achievement. It represents something in your life that will stay with you and which you have the right to be very proud of. You now have the record in a tradition that has been taking place here since the start of the 15th century, but you also represent the future of this wonderful university as its Members stream out into the modern world to make their mark. So again, very very many congratulations to all of you from all of us here. Now in a few minutes you will walk out of this hall into the sunshine and the wide expanse of the summer months. Now lie ahead of you the summer of 2019. The mild days are yours to treasure, and I recommend that you do so with the assuredness of those who've completed a formidable stage in a long journey. So one of the things a university career prompts us to do is to use what we know to reexamine it. So I invite you as you look forward to the lives and careers that await you to also look back to a summer. 50 years ago this year, the summer of 1969, which remains strong in the popular imagination. It was a moment of immense political, social and technological upheaval. There are reverberations of which we still feel today. Following waves of national protests, this was the summer when the new US President Richard Nixon began withdrawing troops from Vietnam in Bethel, New York State. It was the summer when 400,000 people gathered at a farm for a music festival Woodstock featuring acts such as Jimi Hendrix, the Grateful Dead and Janice Joplin. I do hope those names resonate down there that the very resonant up here it was. The summer when Apollo 11. Landed on the Moon and Neil Armstrong proclaimed one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. It won't surprise you to know that in the Mapstone household, as we clustered around a small black and white television, that utterance was met with cries of what about women? The Stonewall riots broke out in New York, and the books that everyone was reading were Maya Angelou's I know why the caged bird sings or Kurt Vonnegut's seminal anti war novel Slaughterhouse Five. It was a summer of dreamers, protesters, reactionaries, dissidents, idealists and radicals. 1969 was memorable in the life of this university, too. In those days we were a community of a little under two and a half thousand students, less than 1/3 of what we are today. But we were questioning and ambitious then too, and as a result, three of our schools, art, history, psychology and computer science are celebrating 50th anniversaries this year. All of these schools have flourished 50 years of hard work. Have ideas of brilliant lecturers and professors, and ingenious students. Sometimes, of course, covering a combination of these three subjects in their studies have created a set of uniquely powerful environments that are recognised as world leading in their fields. And I should add in the presence of graduates and colleagues from the School of Psychology and Neuroscience that the founding chair of Psychology appointed in 1969. Malcolm Jeeves is still a distinguished, active Emeritus professor today, and we're proud to host the annual Jeeves Lecture in his name. So the progress made by these schools over these years should prompt us to reflect on the importance of taking bold action and doing new things and equally a following following those actions through with persistence of the next steps that come after the Great Leap for everybody alongside persistence. These next steps often require that we reach out and take others with us and engage an increasingly diverse and informed Community in our ambitions. That is how real change comes to take shape and have impact, and that is what incidentally, our university strategy for 2018 to 23 which so many people in this room have played a part in. Shaping is all about. Dreaming, protesting and dissenting are important and they have their moments. They are equally paths in life long after the summer of 1969, we continue to protest against war and discrimination. We continue to search for truth in new music and across a range of media and we continue to explore the stars. Though some of us may complain about the unrelenting need for action, wondering when we will ever truly improve, or when we will be content. I take the opposite view because we continue to strive. We continue to succeed, so I hope that whilst with us you've learned to listen and then to argue to imagine and to make a fresh case, these are the deep skills we aim to enable in you and that is how you can make a difference. The road. Of the radical is a long one and one I recommend to you, but precisely because it is a long road, you need to make sure you were properly prepared for it. And for today that requires fun, refueling, and photographs. So many congratulations again. And please do stay in touch with what will always continue to be your university. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas Day at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, said Kumar minibus nobis, and secular secularism Amen."
