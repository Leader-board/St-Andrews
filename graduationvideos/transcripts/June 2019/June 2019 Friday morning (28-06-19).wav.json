team hocquard noon calgary demo rupus fiat at perte quit trump theater cortinas sanctum nomen tuum glorificus at misericordia to a vitamin eternam consequence or periosteum christum dominum nostrum amen please visit it i called upon the principle of the university good morning i am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony at this gathering which officially is a meeting of the sanatos academicals scholars become masters masters become doctors and people of distinction are honoured it is the major celebratory occasion of our academic year and it is a tradition that honours transformation the ceremony marks a significant rite of passage in particular for our students who at the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before and that moment is shared by everyone here in the hall today saint andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation we are proud to be scotland 's first and most ancient university we are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for so i will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony at this point i would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate professor dame julia goodfellow the largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at masters and doctoral level we conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin in accordance with saint andrews tradition we call upon the deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and we then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though we simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the bricks or treason trousers of one of this universities most famous sixteenth century students john knox the major proponent of the reformation in scotland and also amongst other things of the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women so i am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this cap actually had different origins and was purchased in sixteen ninety six for the doctoral graduation of sir john arbuthnot the celebrated scottish physician and satirist he was best known as creator of the memorable character john bull the quintessential englishman described by arbuthnott as an honest plain dealing fellow kolaric bold and a very inconstant temper above the knots cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the seventeenth century when our university was founded in the fifteenth century the magus strand would be capped with the brigham and presented with a ring and an open book these last two signified that the master was wedded to the task of opening up the secrets of the written word and obliged to share his knowledge it was to be almost five centuries before women were to graduate too and during that period the graduation ceremony further evolved the academic dress that we now assume at these ceremonies was largely originated in the victorian era but it was devised on good scholarly principles with much referencing back to medieval costumes and prescribed fashion of the universities of paris and cambridge agnes forbes blackadder was our first female graduate and had a master of arts conferred at a meeting of the sonatas academicas in march eighteen ninety five she went on to achieve eminence as a medic and a dermatologist a year later a further four women graduated and by nineteen thirteen over a third of students were female though the student body of the university changed swiftly much remained constant in the graduation ceremony with women putting on the same black gowns as men though the latin phrasing in the ceremony was adjusted to include the feminine over the past decades it has been necessary to update the latin on several further occasions as new academic subjects have taken root finding latin wordings for a degree in computer science and management required particular ingenuity the inclusion of change is a welcome capacity of graduation and the university continues to change today we are a community of nine thousand students rather than a few hundred whilst we have always been international today almost half of our students come from out with the UK our curricula continued to evolve and new degree programs continue to challenge our latin graduation registers these changes in the programmes our deans recite and the students whose success they record but these transformations are situated against ritual tradition and deeply held values so today after students are awarded their degrees members of saint servatus chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate on dame julia followed by the graduation address which today will be given by professor ruth woodfield the ceremony will close with the benediction by the university chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession graduation is the highlight of the university year we are delighted that you are here to share the success of our graduates i hope that this is a memorable

we encourage versatility i call upon professor gary taylor of the school of biology chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science honoris causa professor dame julia goodfellow julia goodfellow is no stranger to degree ceremonies in july two thousand and seventeen after ten years as the first female vice chancellor and president of the university of kent she presided at her final graduation ceremony in canterbury cathedral twenty two former honorary graduates of the university of kent returned to help celebrate her retirement from a successful period in office dame julia 's legacy is a flourishing highly rated university of twenty thousand students that operates over two main UK campuses with additional centres in brussels paris rome and athens leading to its strapline the UK 's european university retirement is a misnomer though as in two thousand and eighteen dame julia was appointed chair of public health england and president of the royal society of biology she is also in her eighth year as a member of the prime minister 's council for science and technology julia graduated with a BSC in physics from bristol university followed by a PHD in biophysics from the open universities oxford research unit she was interdisciplinary long before that word became a part of every university 's lexicon her research used computational methods to study the folding of proteins the motion of DNA and helped define the critical importance of water molecules in macromolecular structure and biomolecular interactions following her PHD she spent two years as a nato fellow at stanford university before joining the famous department of crystallography at burt beck college london at burbeck her outstanding research captured in over a hundred and twenty publications and in the training of over twenty PHD students saw julia rise quickly up the academic ladder her obvious leadership skills led to her appointment as chair of the department in nineteen ninety six and as vice master of burbeck two years later position she held until two thousand and two when she was appointed as chief executive of the biotechnology and biological research sciences research council or BBSRC she was the first woman to lead a UK research council during her five years at the BBSRC julia oversaw an annual budget of close to four hundred million pounds and led the sector in developing a post genomic strategy obtaining substantial funding from government for so called systems biology a more holistic view of biology than the traditional reductionist approach she also radically changed the BSC 's research institutes integrating many of them within universities and so in two thousand and seven to kent where as well as running the university julia served on many national bodies she was the first female president of universities UK and became a highly effective spokesperson for the higher education sector following the EU referendum in two thousand and sixteen her passion for making science and integral part of the nation 's culture is reflected in her appointment as chair of the british science association and as a trustee of the institute for research in schools julia has received many honors including a CBE in two thousand and one and DBE in two thousand and ten and is a fellow of several national academies including the academy of medical sciences chancellor in recognition of her major contributions to science health academic leadership and for achieving several firsts for women i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science honoris causa on professor dame julia goodfellow tai gradum doctoris scientia honores kaiser provia curious array in symbolum supporte hopefully retain manpower congratulations well good morning everybody i seem to be good afternoon most honourable chancellor most honourable principle thank you and the whole university for this honour i'm really very very grateful it is a real privilege and thank you professor taylor gary who was also in the department of crystallography at burbank where we overlapped thank you for your very very kind words and it's amazing what you've done with my very dry CV so thank you very much indeed people have been talking i know but obviously here today we're here to celebrate you i was going to call you graduates but you're now graduates to you and your families and friends it is an honour to be with you today is about you and it is great to be able to join in your celebration as gary said i have been to a lot of graduation ceremonies and they are wonderful wonderfully great occasions so congratulations to you all now as an academic i'm used to the fifty minute lecture but today i have very strict instructions at two minutes two minutes you have graduated from an ancient and great university and nobody said it yet but congratulations on being seconded the guardian league tables but of course we don't believe in league tables but never mind and you're a university that it supports social responsibility at the heart of its current strategy and that's absolutely wonderful but what i the one message i wanted to say and one thing i want to ask you to do is please remember the values of this institution and many UK universities as you go forth in your careers and these values are the values of the enlightenment the importance of reason and logic of learning and scholarship of law and democracy and the importance of tolerance please take these with you wherever you go wherever you are in the world whatever you're doing congratulations again and thank you all very much indeed i call upon the assistant vice principle for diversity professor ruth woodfield chancellor ladies gentlemen everyone i'd like to start by congratulating you on on your huge achievement attaining a degree is a considerable cause for celebration and today is one to mark your achievement and to reflect on all that you have accomplished congratulations if you look around this hall you'll see many happy and proud faces from my diverse array of backgrounds that this is another cause for celebration over the past decades thousands and thousands of students have graduated from this university but within my lifetime there have been some very notable changes between what this hall looks like today and what it would have looked like fifty years ago for example in the nineteen sixties approximately three quarters of students graduating from UK universities were men today more than half are women around half of young people now attend university in the mid nineteen sixties only about ten percent of young people did very many people could have benefited and enjoyed higher education who did not attend university i was the first person in my family to go to university but i was not the first person to want to pursue higher education my mother left school at fifteen learned shorthand and typing and business skills and secured a job until she married at nineteen when she later sought to improve her career prospects she had two young children and no childcare she worked hard to build up her qualifications but thoughts about progressing further were ultimately thwarted because she could not attend a two week summer school at the open university because my father was in the royal navy and very infrequently at home in his turn my father won a scholarship to art school but his family asked him instead to earn money to contribute towards the family income he left home and became a submariner the navy then was an all male high pressure environment where each sailor was allocated what is affect was affectionately referred to as a tot of free rum a day and hundreds of duty free cigarettes a month it's worth noting that the tot was about an eighth of a pint of fifty percent proof rum what could possibly go wrong the tot was abolished in nineteen seventy following the admiralty board 's proposal and i quote that the rum issue is no longer compatible with the high standards of efficiency required now that the individuals tasks and ships are concerned with complex and often delicate machinery and systems upon which the correct functioning of on of people 's lives may be depend the proposal was not without his critics however a lively debate in parliament saw MP 's arguing against the ban on the grounds that it was unfair and had plunged their constituents into gloom and horror one MP from a medical background stated it is recognised and known not only clinically but in ordinary life that a small dose of alcohol improves performance of the recipient this therefore makes the abolition of the humble tot all the more inconceivable and incomprehensible close quote as this example testifies workplace health and health and safety and worker well being has progressed significantly in my lifetime the casting of women as primarily carers and men as primarily breadwinners has also significantly lessened legal and policy frameworks in the UK and everywhere in the world seek the equal treatment of women and men from a wide range of different backgrounds many organisations have taken great strides towards making the workplace environment one that is fitting for anyone who wants to join it so that a diverse group of people may feel fully included and able to make a positive contribution to illustrate how far we've come last year the royal navy was named in the times top fifty employers for women the efforts of this university to become a place where diverse cohorts of staff and students can flourish has also been recognised by the awards amongst others of athena swan for its promotion for gender equality a career positive award for supporting carers and a stonewall diversity champion award for its work towards LGBT inclusion there is much to be done of course but also very much to be celebrated you are graduating from a with a far more diverse cohort of students than that of fifty years ago you have far greater spreads of choices in in your life the workplace has been transformed in the UK and many other places around the world today you'll find a greater emphasis on an individual 's merit rather than their gender sexuality ethnicity or social class you'll find crashes and nurseries the opportunity for paid parental leave flexible working patterns organisations taking some responsibility for the well being and health and happiness of their staff i would like you to take a moment to savour these changes passing your degree remains one of the most transformative of achievements it provides you with a significantly greater life chance across a whole range of health happiness and well-being measures and far beyond the kind of career or salary that you might enjoy on top of this the fact that you will stand a very good chance of moving into workplaces and family roles where you have so many choices freedoms and higher expectations of how you will be treated recognized and rewarded is certainly worth appreciating as you look to the future and your contribution you will make to society take a moment to cherish these the choices that are before you and the expectations that you will be treated with fairness respect and dignity these expectations are likely to be far greater than the ones available to your parents and grandparents these are not shifts that we should take for granted the path of progress is not linear hard one changes now need defending laws and policies are not always upheld there are always countervailing voices against the principles of equality diversity and inclusion they're probably quite a few people that think having a free hefty tot of rum that strategic point in the working day sounds like a perfectly good idea there are occasions when i do i'll be honest as graduates who are more likely to be in favour of equality and more tolerant of difference this in itself is wonderful and you are a wonderful generation but it probably needs to go further than this for those of you who are minded too i would ask you to champion equality diversity inclusion everywhere who knows what you might achieve in your lifetime to offset any impression that i might have given that i belonged to that monstrous regiment of women referred to before by john knox i'd like to end by passing on some excellence advice that i received from one of my professors on my last day of university he was a profound thinker and a charismatic speaker the kind of professor who often attracted students who weren't taking his courses to his lectures when asked on the last day what advice he could give for a life ahead he simply said ah that's very easy find out what you like doing quite a bit and do quite a lot of it this advice experienced as a little disappointing at the time i've subsequently found to be an excellent motto to live by it doesn't matter whether it's swimming or cycling or knitting or staring at the stars stars or spending time with family or the underrated spending time on your own it doesn't really matter what it is find out what you enjoy doing and spend a bit of time doing it finally congratulations again on your degrees enjoy the day with your friends and families raise a tot in celebration if you want to thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christie at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen sound thank you",

come from out with the UK our curricula continued to evolve and new degree programs continue to challenge our latin graduation registers these changes in the programmes our deans recite and the students whose success they record but these transformations are situated against ritual tradition and deeply held values so today after students are awarded their degrees members of saint servatus chapel choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate on dame julia followed by the graduation address which today will be given by professor ruth woodfield the ceremony will close with the benediction by the university chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession graduation is the highlight of the university year we are delighted that you

goodfellow is no stranger to degree ceremonies in july 2017 after 10 years as the first female vice chancellor and president of the university of kent she presided at her final graduation ceremony in canterbury cathedral 22 former honorary graduates of the university of kent returned to help celebrate her retirement from a successful period in office dame julia's legacy is a flourishing highly rated university of 20,000 students that operates over 2 main UK campuses with additional centres in brussels paris rome and athens leading to its strapline the UK's european university retirement is a misnomer though as in 2018 dame julia was appointed chair of public health england and president of the royal society of biology she is also in her 8th year as a member of the prime minister's council for science and technology julia graduated with a BSC in physics from bristol university followed by a PHD in biophysics from the open universities oxford research unit she was interdisciplinary long before that word became a part of every university's lexicon her research used computational methods to study the folding of proteins the motion of DNA and helped define the critical importance of water molecules in macromolecular structure and biomolecular interactions following her PHD she spent two years as a nato fellow at stanford university before joining the famous department of crystallography at burt beck college london at burbeck her outstanding research captured in over 120 publications and in the training of over 20 PHD students saw julia rise quickly up the academic ladder her obvious leadership skills led to her appointment as chair of the department in 1996 and as vice master of burbeck 2 years later position she held until 2002 when she was appointed as chief executive of the biotechnology and biological research sciences research council or BBSRC she was the first woman to lead a UK research council during her five years at the BBSRC julia oversaw an annual budget of close to £400 million and led the sector in developing a post genomic strategy obtaining substantial funding from government for so called systems biology a more holistic view of biology than the traditional reductionist approach she also radically changed the BSC's research institutes integrating many of them within universities and so in 2007 to kent where as well as running the university julia served on many national bodies she was the first female president of universities UK and became a highly effective spokesperson for the higher education sector following the EU referendum in 2016 her passion for making science and integral part of the nation's culture is reflected in her appointment as chair of the british science association and as a trustee of the institute for research in schools julia has received many honors including a CBE in 2001 and DBE in 2010 and is a fellow of several national academies including the academy of medical sciences chancellor in recognition of her major contributions to science health academic leadership and for achieving several firsts for women i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science honoris causa on professor dame julia goodfellow tai gradum doctoris scientia honores kaiser provia curious array in symbolum supporte hopefully retain manpower congratulations well good morning everybody i seem to be good afternoon most honourable chancellor most honourable principle thank you and the whole university for this honour i'm really very very grateful it is a real privilege and thank you professor taylor gary who was also in the department of crystallography at burbank where we overlapped thank you for your very very kind words and it's amazing what you've done with my very dry CV so thank you very much indeed people have been talking i know but obviously here today we're here to celebrate you i was going to call you graduates but you're now graduates to you and your families and friends it is an honour to be with you today is about you and it is great to be able to join in your celebration as gary said i have been to a lot of graduation ceremonies and they are wonderful wonderfully great occasions so congratulations to you all now as an academic i'm used to the 50 minute lecture but today i have very strict instructions at 2 minutes 2 minutes you have graduated from an ancient and great university and nobody said it yet but congratulations on being seconded the guardian league tables but of course we don't believe in league tables but never mind and you're a university that it supports social responsibility at the heart of its current strategy and that's absolutely wonderful but what i the one message i wanted to say and one thing i want to ask you to do is please remember the values of this institution and many UK universities as you go forth in your careers and these values are the values of the enlightenment the importance of reason and logic of learning and scholarship of law and democracy and the importance of tolerance please take these with you wherever you go wherever you are in the world whatever you're doing congratulations again and thank you all very much indeed i call upon the assistant vice principle for diversity professor ruth woodfield chancellor ladies gentlemen everyone i'd like to start by congratulating you on on your huge achievement attaining a degree is a considerable cause for celebration and today is 1 to mark your achievement and to reflect on all that you have accomplished congratulations if you look around this hall you'll see many happy and proud faces from my diverse array of backgrounds that this is another cause for celebration over the past decades thousands and thousands of students have graduated from this university but within my lifetime there have been some very notable changes between what this hall looks like today and what it would have looked like 50 years ago for example in the 1960s approximately 3/4 of students graduating from UK universities were men today more than half are women around half of young people now attend university in the mid 1960s only about 10% of young people did very many people could have benefited and enjoyed higher education who did not attend university i was the first person in my family to go to university but i was not the first person to want to pursue higher education my mother left school at 15 learned shorthand and typing and business skills and secured a job until she married at 19 when she later sought to improve her career prospects she had two young children and no childcare she worked hard to build up her qualifications but thoughts about progressing further were ultimately thwarted because she could not attend a two week summer school at the open university because my father was in the royal navy and very infrequently at home in his turn my father won a scholarship to art school but his family asked him instead to earn money to contribute towards the family income he left home and became a submariner the navy then was an all male high pressure environment where each sailor was allocated what is affect was affectionately referred to as a tot of free rum a day and hundreds of duty free cigarettes a month it's worth noting that the tot was about an eighth of a pint of 50% proof rum what could possibly go wrong the tot was abolished in 1970 following the admiralty board's proposal and i quote that the rum issue is no longer compatible with the high standards of efficiency required now that the individuals tasks and ships are concerned with complex and often delicate machinery and systems upon which the correct functioning of on of people's lives may be depend the proposal was not without his critics however a lively debate in parliament saw MP's arguing against the ban on the grounds that it was unfair and had plunged their constituents into gloom and horror one MP from a medical background stated it is recognised and known not only clinically but in ordinary life that a small dose of alcohol improves performance of the recipient this therefore makes the abolition of the humble tot all the more inconceivable and incomprehensible close quote as this example testifies workplace health and health and safety and worker well being has progressed significantly in my lifetime the casting of women as primarily carers and men as primarily breadwinners has also significantly lessened legal and policy frameworks in the UK and everywhere in the world seek the equal treatment of women and men from a wide range of different backgrounds many organisations have taken great strides towards making the workplace environment one that is fitting for anyone who wants to join it so that a diverse group of people may feel fully included and able to make a positive contribution to illustrate how far we've come last year the royal navy was named in the times top 50 employers for women the efforts of this university to become a place where diverse cohorts of staff and students can flourish has also been recognised by the awards amongst others of athena swan for its promotion for gender equality a career positive award for supporting carers and a stonewall diversity champion award for its work towards LGBT inclusion there is much to be done of course but also very much to be celebrated you are graduating from a with a far more diverse cohort of students than that of 50 years ago you have far greater spreads of choices in in your life the workplace has been transformed in the UK and many other places around the world today you'll find a greater emphasis on an individual's merit rather than their gender sexuality ethnicity or social class you'll find crashes and nurseries the opportunity for paid parental leave flexible working patterns organisations taking some responsibility for the well being and health and happiness of their staff i would like you to take a moment to savour these changes passing your degree remains one of the most transformative of achievements it provides you with a significantly greater life chance across a whole range of health happiness and well-being measures and far beyond the kind of career or salary that you might enjoy on top of this the fact that you will stand a very good chance of moving into workplaces and family roles where you have so many choices freedoms and higher expectations of how you will be treated recognized and rewarded is certainly worth appreciating as you look to the future and your contribution you will make to society take a moment to cherish these the choices that are before you and the expectations that you will be treated with fairness respect and dignity these expectations are likely to be far greater than the ones available to your parents and grandparents these are not shifts that we should take for granted the path of progress is not linear hard one changes now need defending laws and policies are not always upheld there are always countervailing voices against the principles of equality diversity and inclusion they're probably quite a few people that think having a free hefty tot of rum that strategic point in the working day sounds like a perfectly good idea there are occasions when i do i'll be honest as graduates who are more likely to be in favour of equality and more tolerant of difference this in itself is wonderful and you are a wonderful generation but it probably needs to go further than this for those of you who are minded too i would ask you to champion equality diversity inclusion everywhere who knows what you might achieve in your lifetime to offset any impression that i might have given that i belonged to that monstrous regiment of women referred to before by john knox i'd like to end by passing on some excellence advice that i received from one of my professors on my last day of university he was a profound thinker and a charismatic speaker the kind of professor who often attracted students who weren't taking his courses to his lectures when asked on the last day what advice he could give for a life ahead he simply said ah that's very easy find out what you like doing quite a bit and do quite a lot of it this advice experienced as a little disappointing at the time i've subsequently found to be an excellent motto to live by it doesn't matter whether it's swimming or cycling or knitting or staring at the stars stars or spending time with family or the underrated spending time on your own it doesn't really matter what it is find out what you enjoy doing and spend a bit of time doing it finally congratulations again on your degrees enjoy the day with your friends and families raise a tot in celebration if you want to thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christie at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen sound thank you",

      "display": "May I have your attention please? Good morning graduates.

Fiat at Perte quit Trump theater. Cortinas sanctum nomen tuum, glorificus at Misericordia, to a vitamin eternam consequence or periosteum christum dominum nostrum, Amen. Please visit it. I called upon the principle of the university. Good morning. I am delighted to welcome you to this graduation ceremony. At this gathering, which officially is a meeting of the Sanatos Academicals, scholars become Masters, Masters become doctors and people of distinction are honoured. It is the major celebratory occasion of our academic year, and it is a tradition that honours transformation. The ceremony marks a significant rite of passage, in particular for our students who at the moment of graduation becomes something that they were not before. And that moment is shared by everyone here in the hall today. Saint Andrews is a place equally of cherished tradition and bold transformation. We are proud to be Scotland's first and most ancient university. We are equally proud to be a university that is amongst the most modern and forward looking important in all of this is that as we change we both hold to and reframe the values that we stand for. So I will now tell you something of the history of our graduation ceremony before concluding with a few remarks about today's ceremony. At this point I would like to extend a particular welcome on behalf of the university to today's honorary graduate Professor, Dame Julia Goodfellow. The largest part of our ceremony today takes the form of the conferment of degrees at Masters and doctoral level. We conferred degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin, in accordance with Saint Andrews tradition, we call upon the Deans of the faculties in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and we then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though. We simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This particular cap was long thought to be a piece of the bricks or treason trousers of one of this universities. Most famous 16th century students, John Knox, the major proponent of the Reformation in Scotland and also, amongst other things of the 1st. Blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women. So I am quite relieved to tell you that research has shown that this CAP actually had different origins and was purchased in 1696 for the doctoral graduation of Sir John Arbuthnot, the celebrated Scottish physician and satirist. He was best known as creator of the memorable character, John Bull, the quintessential Englishman described by Arbuthnott as an honest plain dealing fellow kolaric. Bold and a very inconstant temper. Above the knots cap has thus been in use in our graduation ceremonies since the end of the 17th century. When our university was founded in the 15th century, the Magus Strand would be capped with the Brigham and presented with a ring and an open book. These last two signified that the master was wedded to the task of opening up the secrets of the written word and obliged to share his knowledge. It was to be almost 5 centuries before women were to graduate too, and during that. The graduation ceremony further evolved. The academic dress that we now assume at these ceremonies was largely originated in the Victorian era, but it was devised on good scholarly principles with much referencing back to medieval costumes and prescribed fashion of the universities of Paris and Cambridge. Agnes Forbes Blackadder was our first female graduate and had a Master of Arts conferred at a meeting of the sonatas academicas in March 1895. She went on to achieve eminence as a medic and a dermatologist. A year later, a further four women graduated and by 1913 / 1/3 of students were female. Though the student body of the university changed swiftly, much remained constant in the graduation ceremony, with women putting on the same black gowns as men, though the Latin phrasing in the ceremony was adjusted to include the feminine over the past decades, it has been necessary to update the Latin on several further occasions as new academic subjects have taken root, finding Latin wordings for a degree in computer science and management required particular ingenuity. The inclusion of change is a welcome capacity of graduation and the university continues to change today. We are a community of 9000 students rather than a few 100. Whilst we have always been international today, almost half of our students come from out with the UK. Our curricula continued to evolve and new degree programs continue to challenge our Latin. Graduation registers these changes in the programmes our Deans recite and the students whose success they record. But these transformations are situated against ritual tradition and deeply held values. So today, after students are awarded their degrees, members of Saint Servatus Chapel Choir will perform before we proceed to the confirment of an honorary doctorate on Dame Julia, followed by the graduation address, which today will be given by Professor Ruth Woodfield. The ceremony will close with the benediction by the University chaplain and the new graduates will join the academic procession. Graduation is the highlight of the university year. We are delighted that you are here to share the success of our graduates. I hope that this is a memorable and most happy day for all of you. The Canes faculty Artis artium. Chancellor.

We encourage versatility. I call upon Professor Gary Taylor of the School of Biology. Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science honoris causa Professor, Dame Julia Goodfellow. Julia Goodfellow is no stranger to degree ceremonies. In July 2017, after 10 years as the first female Vice Chancellor and president of the University of Kent. She presided at her final graduation ceremony in Canterbury Cathedral. 22 former honorary graduates of the University of Kent returned to help celebrate her retirement from a successful. In office. Dame Julia's legacy is a flourishing, highly rated university of 20,000 students that operates over 2 main UK campuses with additional centres in Brussels, Paris, Rome and Athens. Leading to its strapline, the UK's European University. Retirement is a misnomer though, as in 2018, Dame Julia was appointed Chair of Public Health England. And president of the Royal Society of Biology. She is also in her 8th year as a member of the Prime Minister's Council for Science and Technology. Julia graduated with a BSc in physics from Bristol University, followed by a PhD in biophysics from the Open Universities Oxford Research Unit. She was interdisciplinary, long before that word became a part of every university's lexicon. Her research used computational methods to study the folding of proteins. The motion of DNA, and helped define the critical importance of water molecules in macromolecular structure and biomolecular interactions. Following her PhD, she spent two years as a NATO fellow at Stanford University. Before joining the famous Department of Crystallography at Burt Beck College London. At Burbeck, her outstanding research captured in over 120 publications and in the training of over 20 PhD students. Saw Julia rise quickly up the academic ladder. Her obvious leadership skills led to her appointment as chair of the department in 1996 and as Vice Master of Burbeck 2 years later position she held until 2002 when she was appointed as chief executive of the Biotechnology and Biological Research Sciences Research Council or BBSRC. She was the first woman to lead a UK Research Council. During her five years at the BBSRC, Julia oversaw an annual budget of close to £400 million and led the sector in developing a post genomic strategy, obtaining substantial funding from government for so called Systems Biology, a more holistic view of biology than the traditional reductionist approach. She also radically changed the BSC's research institutes, integrating many of them within universities. And so, in 2007 to Kent. Where as well as running the university, Julia served on many national bodies. She was the first female president of Universities UK and became a highly effective spokesperson for the higher education sector following the EU referendum in 2016. Her passion for making science and integral part of the nation's culture is reflected in her appointment as chair of the British Science Association and as a trustee of the Institute for Research in Schools. Julia has received many honors, including a CBE in 2001, and DBE in 2010 and is a fellow of several national academies, including the Academy of Medical Sciences. Chancellor, in recognition of her major contributions to science health, academic leadership and for achieving several firsts for women. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science honoris causa on Professor Dame Julia Goodfellow. Tai Gradum doctoris Scientia honores Kaiser Provia curious array in symbolum supporte, hopefully retain manpower. Congratulations. Well, good morning everybody. I seem to be good afternoon. Most honourable Chancellor most honourable principle, thank you and the whole university for this honour. I'm really very, very grateful. It is a real privilege. And thank you, Professor Taylor Gary, who was also in the Department of Crystallography at Burbank, where we overlapped. Thank you for your very, very kind words and it's amazing what you've done with my very dry CV. So thank you very much indeed. People have been talking, I know, but obviously here today we're here to celebrate you. I was going to call you graduates, but you're now graduates to you and your families and friends. It is an honour to be with you today is about you and it is great to be able to join in your celebration. As Gary said, I have been to a lot of graduation ceremonies and they are wonderful, wonderfully great occasions. So congratulations to you all. Now, as an academic, I'm used to the 50 minute lecture, but today I have very strict instructions at 2 minutes 2 minutes. You have graduated from an ancient and great university and nobody said it yet. But congratulations on being seconded, the Guardian League tables. But of course we don't believe in league tables, but never mind. And you're a university that it supports social responsibility at the heart of its current strategy. And that's absolutely wonderful. But what I the one message I wanted to say and one thing I want to ask you to do is Please remember the values of this institution and many UK universities as you go forth in your careers. And these values are the values of the Enlightenment, the importance of reason and logic of learning and scholarship of law and democracy. And the importance of tolerance. Please take these with you wherever you go, wherever you are in the world. Whatever you're doing, congratulations again and thank you all. Very much indeed. I call upon the assistant vice principle for diversity Professor Ruth Woodfield. Chancellor ladies gentlemen, everyone. I'd like to start by congratulating you on on your huge achievement. Attaining a degree is a considerable cause for celebration, and today is 1 to mark your achievement and to reflect on all that you have accomplished. Congratulations if you look around this hall, you'll see many happy and proud faces from my diverse array of backgrounds that this is another cause for celebration. Over the past decades. Thousands and thousands of students have graduated from this university, but within my lifetime there have been some very notable changes between what this hall looks like today and what it would have looked like 50 years ago. For example, in the 1960s, approximately 3/4 of students graduating from UK universities were men. Today, more than half are women. Around half of young people now attend university. In the mid 1960s, only about 10% of young people did. Very many people could have benefited and enjoyed higher education who did not attend university. I was the first person in my family to go to university, but I was not the first person to want to pursue higher education. My mother left school at 15, learned shorthand and typing and business skills and secured a job until she married at 19. When she later sought to improve her career prospects, she had two young children and no childcare. She worked hard to build up her qualifications, but thoughts about progressing further were ultimately thwarted. Because she could not attend a two week summer school at the Open University because my father was in the Royal Navy and very infrequently at home. In his turn, my father won a scholarship to art school, but his family asked him instead to earn money to contribute towards the family income he left home and became a submariner. The Navy then was an all male high pressure environment where each sailor was allocated. What is affect was affectionately referred to as a tot of free rum a day and hundreds of duty free cigarettes a month. It's worth noting that the tot was about an eighth of a pint of 50% proof rum. What could possibly go wrong? The TOT was abolished in 1970 following the Admiralty Board's proposal, and I quote that the rum issue is no longer compatible with the high standards of efficiency required. Now that the individuals, tasks and ships are concerned with complex and often delicate machinery and systems upon which the correct functioning of on of people's lives may be depend. The proposal was not without his critics, however. A lively debate in Parliament saw MP's arguing against the ban on the grounds that it was unfair and had plunged their constituents into gloom and horror. One MP from a medical background stated it is recognised and known not only clinically but in ordinary life that a small dose of alcohol improves performance of the recipient. This therefore makes the abolition of the humble tot all the more inconceivable and incomprehensible. ” as this example testifies, workplace health and health and safety and worker well being has progressed significantly in my lifetime. The casting of women as primarily carers and men as primarily breadwinners, has also significantly lessened legal and policy frameworks in the UK and everywhere in the world seek the equal treatment of women and men from a wide range of different backgrounds. Many organisations have taken great strides towards making the workplace. Environment, One that is fitting for anyone who wants to join it so that a diverse group of people may feel fully included and able to make a positive contribution. To illustrate how far we've come last year, the Royal Navy was named in the Times Top 50 employers for women. The efforts of this university to become a place where diverse cohorts of staff and students can flourish has also been recognised by the awards, amongst others, of Athena Swan for its promotion for gender equality, a career positive award for supporting carers, and a Stonewall Diversity Champion award for its work towards LGBT inclusion. There is much to be done, of course. But also very much to be celebrated. You are graduating from a with a far more diverse cohort of students than that of 50 years ago. You have far greater spreads of choices in in your life. The workplace has been transformed in the UK and many other places around the world. Today you'll find a greater emphasis on an individual's merit rather than their gender, sexuality, ethnicity, or social class. You'll find crashes and nurseries the opportunity for paid parental leave. Flexible working patterns. Organisations taking some responsibility for the well being and health and happiness of their staff. I would like you to take a moment to savour these changes. Passing your degree remains one of the most transformative of achievements. It provides you with a significantly greater life chance across a whole range of health, happiness and well-being. Measures and far beyond the kind of career or salary that you might enjoy. On top of this, the fact that you will stand a very good chance of moving into workplaces and family roles where you have so many choices, freedoms and higher expectations of how you will be treated. Recognized and rewarded is certainly worth appreciating. As you look to the future and your contribution, you will make to society. Take a moment to cherish these. The choices that are before you and the expectations that you will be treated with. Fairness, respect and dignity. These expectations are likely to be far greater than the ones available to your parents and grandparents. These are not shifts that we should take for granted. The path of progress is not linear hard. One changes now need defending laws and policies are not always upheld. There are always countervailing voices against the principles of equality. Diversity and inclusion. They're probably quite a few people that think having a free hefty tot of rum that strategic point in the working day sounds like a perfectly good idea. There are occasions when I do, I'll be honest as graduates who are more likely to be in favour of equality and more tolerant of difference. This in itself is wonderful and you are a wonderful generation, but it probably needs to go further than this. For those of you who are minded too, I would ask you to champion equality, diversity, inclusion everywhere. Who knows what you might achieve in your lifetime to offset any impression that I might have given that I belonged to that monstrous regiment of women referred to before by John Knox. I'd like to end by passing on some excellence advice that I received from one of my professors on my last day of university. He was a profound thinker and a charismatic speaker. The kind of professor who often attracted students who weren't taking his courses to his lectures. When asked on the last day, what advice he could give for a life ahead, he simply said. Ah, that's very easy. Find out what you like doing quite a bit, and do quite a lot of it. This advice experienced as a little disappointing at the time. I've subsequently found to be an excellent motto to live by. It doesn't matter whether it's swimming or cycling or knitting or staring at the stars, stars, or spending time with family or the underrated spending time on your own. It doesn't really matter what it is. Find out what you enjoy doing and spend a bit of time doing it. Finally, congratulations again on your degrees. Enjoy the day with your friends and families. Raise a tot in celebration. If you want to thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christie at Caritas Day at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen. Sound. Thank you."
