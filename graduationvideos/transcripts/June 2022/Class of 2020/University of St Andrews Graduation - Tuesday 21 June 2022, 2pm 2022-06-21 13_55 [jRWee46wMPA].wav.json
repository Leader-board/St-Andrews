dominum nostrum ahmed please be seated good afternoon everyone it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduate serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the way in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learnt primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by one 's professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at fifteenth century saint andrews as too distracting but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasion second thoughts in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows student life in saint leonards college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started class at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continued to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly prohibited less they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over fifty years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox i need modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds saint andrews had become as described by one contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundreds student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred gathered guests garden parties were spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of a hundred and forty five universities and learned societies visited and hundred honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in july in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honor of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors it is therefore sight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities two years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july twenty twenty and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time the graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards that bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at super tay 's meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our theaters chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour sir kenneth dalgleish MBE to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor rhiannon purdy from the school of english the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your achievements but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus speckled artis arzum the vice chancellor i ask

stephanie martin at superta i call upon professor sharon ashbrook of the school of chemistry vice chancellor it is my privilege to present that the degree of doctor of laws on all risk causa sir kenneth matheson dalgleish so kenneth is quite simply a footballing legend and one of scotland 's greatest ever sports people he was also personally responsible for what my eleven year old self considered the best day of her life in nineteen eighty six when he scored the only goal against chelsea in the last game of the season securing liverpool football club league and cup double so kenneth or king kenny is he's perhaps better known to generations of football fans was born and brought up in glasgow despite starting out as a goalkeeper he excelled as a striker during his playing career he made over eight hundred and fifty appearances for liverpool and celtic scoring three hundred and forty five goals he was part of teams that won three european cups a european super cup ten league championships and multiple scottish and english cups and league cups he's scotland 's most capped player with one hundred and two appearances and their joint equal top goal scorer with thirty goals although i was warned by my head of school not to mention a particularly painful one in nineteen seventy six against ray clements in england in twenty twenty he was voted by fans of scotland 's greatest international footballer so kind of there's also had a successful career as a manager initially with livable with whom he won another three league championships he's been inducted into the scottish and english football halls of fame and in nineteen eighty five he was awarded an MBE for his services to football it is noteworthy however that although the citation for his knighthood with which he was honoured in twenty eighteen mentions these footballing achievements it highlights his charity work and wider service to the city of liverpool the charity he founded in two thousand and four jointly with his wife marina i'm very pleased to say also joins us here today has raised many millions of pounds to support the treatment of and research into cancer with two liverpool hospitals aintree and broadgreen being particular beneficiaries so kenneth was manager of liverpool during one of the club 's darkest days the hillsborough disaster in nineteen eighty nine which recently claimed its ninety seventh victim while the rights and wrongs of the events that day were played out on the front of tabloid newspapers and ultimately in the courts so kenneth of course was on the ground supporting his players visiting the injured and the families of those who had lost loved ones and attending the funerals of all who had died his selfless and unwavering support for the families and communities of the city in the most difficult of times will never be forgotten when i was asked to give this address i asked my colleagues family and friends for advice it was noticeable that everybody had a kenny story how they'd met him how they mannered met him how a particular game or goal had made or for some others completely devastated a season for them let me though the most telling comment came from my mum who despite living in a family of liverpool fans is about as uninterested in football as it's possible to be on hearing that i would be speaking here today she said kenny dalglish you don't like him i think he was quite good high praise indeed vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to football to charity and to wider society i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of laws honoris councillor on sir kenneth dalgleish tay edgardo doctoris legum honoris causa promoviendo kuyas three in symbolum superette hope berekum imponer congratulations again vice chancellor that says no one in my forties standing up to speak but i think it's only right when somebody gives you a huge presentation that you say at least thank you and for me marina and i have lived in england longer than we've both lived in scotland but that's not what you say that that means then anyways this obviously boy growing up in glasgow and it was either he followed the gun culture or you you could run fast but fortunately i could run fast so i escaped a bit of trouble and whatever there that we were brought up to he be respectful of people the respectful of people 's position and life and probably brought up to be fortunate that we could go on with life my parents were fantastically supportive of myself when i was playing football as a as a wee boy football unlike the university you mentioned earlier never banned football in their house we had we had great times with the football your dad takes you to the football you go and play your dad comes in watching when you play and you just goes through here and through your veins the physician must still report you have been thankful that the abiba an idea how he played football but i wasn't coming here to do exactly what you did and congratulations to the the people we've all had their graduation presentations today but i was never getting anywhere near that that way we passed my eleven plus but that was a bit but for me it was football and throughout the year you're you're older years he he played develop and i was forced now that i played with to or under the to the most successful managers and in british football jobs team and bob beasley for me it was a it was easy to play the success that i had there's no one individual sport it's a team sport and irrespective of whether you made a contribution which would be nice and think maybe abused the privilege that it was a team sport by no making the contribution too often it was it was all about us it wasn't about me and i think in life that's the way that you've got the you've got to to yourself forward seventy four married marina it was very nice of her they proposed to me and that was just well for me it was a no brainer for marina i think you took a bit of persuasion but four children later and me at exactly where our parents wanted us to be consider it for other people respectful of other people and if you can't do somebody a favor i don't see any reason why we should do them a bad turn so unfortunately between the year ago marina fell out and we started off the charity which was the way it was seen thank you to the people who had looked after us in the hospital and but it was we were there i thought maybe a little bit late to do something for the charity for the the hospital if we could help and i thought maybe it'd be a game a goal for or something that they could play and they said we've got the fifth floor of the hospital that used to be a maternity ward that has been closed down and bit late to renovate that into a chemotherapy ward i felt well i don't think a game of golf will cover that course so we say our the charity and it's it's not your money it's marina working at it diligently the our daughters working at it as well the fact lauren and the youngest one she runs it and i just do them told so whatever they tell me it's done and it's helping people tremendously and in liverpool and also we did stuff up in glasgow as well so for me it's a that's about your life and it's great that you have all got your your certificates are qualification and i hope and i'm sure you will put them to good use and for me the greatest memory is to remember and help people less fortunate than yourself this is greatly appreciated thank you i call upon professor rhiannon purdy of the school of english tell you what it's not easier to come up here and follow king kenny but vice chancellor 's colleagues special guests and graduates you'll be glad to know there's four minutes left now here's a statement that the graduation address never normally starts with welcome back normally the point of a graduation address is to wave and cheer on behalf of the university as we launch you into the world but for you the class of twenty twenty the world was suddenly turned on its head during the final few weeks of your degrees with global covid nineteen pandemic we all found ourselves locked up pixelating and stuttering through the remaining classes online i know you remember it all too well you got through strange final assessments online only to realize that the graduation celebrations which your previous four or five years have been leading up to would have to be postponed maybe you envied the class of twenty twenty one whose graduation obviously wouldn't be blighted cause of course the pandemic would be long gone by then now next i would normally say something once sentimental and vaguely threatening like you might not realise it yet but saint andrews has become part of you you will find yourself inexorably drawn back to visit this place where you became an adult but you've already been out in the rough and tumble of the world for two years and you've come back you know this as a simple fact you also probably don't need the kinds of advice we normally offer at a starry starry eyed new graduates but i'm an academic and i pontificate to audiences for a living i'm like that annoying elderly aunt who corners you at a wedding reception when you just want a party with everybody else so i'm gonna plow ahead and i'm going to give you some advice right so the first thing is something my father told me when i was agonizing over whether or not to come back and do a PHD clearly you know spoiler alert i was teaching english in japan at the time which was huge fun and very difficult to give up i worried about the kind of debt i would rack up if i went back to studying i fretted about how old i'd be almost thirty before i finished and i could embark on a sort of grown up career of some kind at last i thought my father would have an opinion one way or the other and i was all set to argue about it whatever it was but he just said well you know the real difficulty in life isn't doing things it's figuring out your priorities you can't do or have everything so which is the thing you most want and that you'll sacrifice other things for if necessary that's the difficult call to make once you've made it the rest is just admin so just admin might oversimplify things a little bit but i have found this advice genuinely useful so i pass it on to you in the hopes that you will too the second slightly more controversial piece of advice comes from my friend let's call her morag many years ago when our sons were in primary school together her son was getting bullied by an older boy who was really starting to knock him about now morag had always taught her sons that hitting people was wrong the violence was never the answer you talk things out etcetera but talking just wasn't working with this bully and her son asked her anxiously what you should do more i've looked down into a little boy 's face and she imagined this older kid terrorizing him and she really really tried to give her usual advice that you should never ever hit anyone did i mention more i was from glasgow anyway anyway she ended up saying look you should never hit people and she took a big breath but if you ever do have to hit someone darling make it a cracker so like morag i do not advocate violence i'm a professor of english i mean you take this story on a purely metaphorical level alright metaphor so with that in mind class of twenty twenty if life ever puts you in the kind of intolerable position where all negotiation and compromise has failed and you have no other recourse but to throw a metaphorical punch remember your scottish training make it a cracker right right huge congratulations to you all the resilient class of twenty twenty and to the families who supported you all through it as well enjoy your time back in saint andrews this week and go party you've earned it OK in order to do that please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti said kumon nebus nobis in secular secularism amen",

summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929 the younger hall closed in july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduate serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the way in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of 15th century st andrews learnt primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until 1747 examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by one's professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century st andrews as too distracting but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasion second thoughts in 1470 when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows student life in st leonards college over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at 5:00 AM attended mass at six started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continued to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly prohibited less they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over 50 years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in 1742 james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in 1775 and in 1792 edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox i need modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s saint andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of 1858 introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in 1892 and by the 1900s student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september 1911 which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties were spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in july in june 1929 its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honor of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors it is therefore sight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities 2 years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july 2020 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time the graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards that bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at super tay's meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our theaters chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour sir kenneth dalgleish MBE to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor rhiannon purdy from the school of english the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your achievements but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life decanus speckled artis arzum the vice chancellor i ask you to confirm the degree of master of arts general on fred mcbride take add gradam

stephanie martin at superta i call upon professor sharon ashbrook of the school of chemistry vice chancellor it is my privilege to present that the degree of doctor of laws on all risk causa sir kenneth matheson dalgleish so kenneth is quite simply a footballing legend and one of scotland's greatest ever sports people he was also personally responsible for what my 11 year old self considered the best day of her life in 1986 when he scored the only goal against chelsea in the last game of the season securing liverpool football club league and cup double so kenneth or king kenny is he's perhaps better known to generations of football fans was born and brought up in glasgow despite starting out as a goalkeeper he excelled as a striker during his playing career he made over 850 appearances for liverpool and celtic scoring 345 goals he was part of teams that won three european cups a european super cup 10 league championships and multiple scottish and english cups and league cups he's scotland's most capped player with 102 appearances and their joint equal top goal scorer with 30 goals although i was warned by my head of school not to mention a particularly painful one in 1976 against ray clements in england in 2020 he was voted by fans of scotland's greatest international footballer so kind of there's also had a successful career as a manager initially with livable with whom he won another three league championships he's been inducted into the scottish and english football halls of fame and in 1985 he was awarded an MBE for his services to football it is noteworthy however that although the citation for his knighthood with which he was honoured in 2018 mentions these footballing achievements it highlights his charity work and wider service to the city of liverpool the charity he founded in 2004 jointly with his wife marina i'm very pleased to say also joins us here today has raised many millions of pounds to support the treatment of and research into cancer with two liverpool hospitals aintree and broadgreen being particular beneficiaries so kenneth was manager of liverpool during one of the club's darkest days the hillsborough disaster in 1989 which recently claimed its 97th victim while the rights and wrongs of the events that day were played out on the front of tabloid newspapers and ultimately in the courts so kenneth of course was on the ground supporting his players visiting the injured and the families of those who had lost loved ones and attending the funerals of all who had died his selfless and unwavering support for the families and communities of the city in the most difficult of times will never be forgotten when i was asked to give this address i asked my colleagues family and friends for advice it was noticeable that everybody had a kenny story how they'd met him how they mannered met him how a particular game or goal had made or for some others completely devastated a season for them let me though the most telling comment came from my mum who despite living in a family of liverpool fans is about as uninterested in football as it's possible to be on hearing that i would be speaking here today she said kenny dalglish you don't like him i think he was quite good high praise indeed vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to football to charity and to wider society i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of laws honoris councillor on sir kenneth dalgleish tay edgardo doctoris legum honoris causa promoviendo kuyas 3IN symbolum superette hope berekum imponer congratulations again vice chancellor that says no one in my 40s standing up to speak but i think it's only right when somebody gives you a huge presentation that you say at least thank you and for me marina and i have lived in england longer than we've both lived in scotland but that's not what you say that that means then anyways this obviously boy growing up in glasgow and it was either he followed the gun culture or you you could run fast but fortunately i could run fast so i escaped a bit of trouble and whatever there that we were brought up to he be respectful of people the respectful of people's position and life and probably brought up to be fortunate that we could go on with life my parents were fantastically supportive of myself when i was playing football as a as a wee boy football unlike the university you mentioned earlier never banned football in their house we had we had great times with the football your dad takes you to the football you go and play your dad comes in watching when you play and you just goes through here and through your veins the physician must still report you have been thankful that the abiba an idea how he played football but i wasn't coming here to do exactly what you did and congratulations to the the people we've all had their graduation presentations today but i was never getting anywhere near that that way we passed my 11 plus but that was a bit but for me it was football and throughout the year you're you're older years he he played develop and i was forced now that i played with to or under the to the most successful managers and in british football jobs team and bob beasley for me it was a it was easy to play the success that i had there's no one individual sport it's a team sport and irrespective of whether you made a contribution which would be nice and think maybe abused the privilege that it was a team sport by no making the contribution too often it was it was all about us it wasn't about me and i think in life that's the way that you've got the you've got to to yourself forward 74 married marina it was very nice of her they proposed to me and that was just well for me it was a no brainer for marina i think you took a bit of persuasion but four children later and me at exactly where our parents wanted us to be consider it for other people respectful of other people and if you can't do somebody a favor i don't see any reason why we should do them a bad turn so unfortunately between the year ago marina fell out and we started off the charity which was the way it was seen thank you to the people who had looked after us in the hospital and but it was we were there i thought maybe a little bit late to do something for the charity for the the hospital if we could help and i thought maybe it'd be a game a goal for or something that they could play and they said we've got the 5th floor of the hospital that used to be a maternity ward that has been closed down and bit late to renovate that into a chemotherapy ward i felt well i don't think a game of golf will cover that course so we say our the charity and it's it's not your money it's marina working at it diligently the our daughters working at it as well the fact lauren and the youngest one she runs it and i just do them told so whatever they tell me it's done and it's helping people tremendously and in liverpool and also we did stuff up in glasgow as well so for me it's a that's about your life and it's great that you have all got your your certificates are qualification and i hope and i'm sure you will put them to good use and for me the greatest memory is to remember and help people less fortunate than yourself this is greatly appreciated thank you i call upon professor rhiannon purdy of the school of english tell you what it's not easier to come up here and follow king kenny but vice chancellor's colleagues special guests and graduates you'll be glad to know there's 4 minutes left now here's a statement that the graduation address never normally starts with welcome back normally the point of a graduation address is to wave and cheer on behalf of the university as we launch you into the world but for you the class of 2020 the world was suddenly turned on its head during the final few weeks of your degrees with global COVID-19 pandemic we all found ourselves locked up pixelating and stuttering through the remaining classes online i know you remember it all too well you got through strange final assessments online only to realize that the graduation celebrations which your previous four or five years have been leading up to would have to be postponed maybe you envied the class of 2021 whose graduation obviously wouldn't be blighted cause of course the pandemic would be long gone by then now next i would normally say something once sentimental and vaguely threatening like you might not realise it yet but saint andrews has become part of you you will find yourself inexorably drawn back to visit this place where you became an adult but you've already been out in the rough and tumble of the world for two years and you've come back you know this as a simple fact you also probably don't need the kinds of advice we normally offer at a starry starry eyed new graduates but i'm an academic and i pontificate to audiences for a living i'm like that annoying elderly aunt who corners you at a wedding reception when you just want a party with everybody else so i'm gonna plow ahead and i'm going to give you some advice right so the first thing is something my father told me when i was agonizing over whether or not to come back and do a PHD clearly you know spoiler alert i was teaching english in japan at the time which was huge fun and very difficult to give up i worried about the kind of debt i would rack up if i went back to studying i fretted about how old i'd be almost 30 before i finished and i could embark on a sort of grown up career of some kind at last i thought my father would have an opinion one way or the other and i was all set to argue about it whatever it was but he just said well you know the real difficulty in life isn't doing things it's figuring out your priorities you can't do or have everything so which is the thing you most want and that you'll sacrifice other things for if necessary that's the difficult call to make once you've made it the rest is just admin so just admin might oversimplify things a little bit but i have found this advice genuinely useful so i pass it on to you in the hopes that you will too the second slightly more controversial piece of advice comes from my friend let's call her morag many years ago when our sons were in primary school together her son was getting bullied by an older boy who was really starting to knock him about now morag had always taught her sons that hitting people was wrong the violence was never the answer you talk things out etcetera but talking just wasn't working with this bully and her son asked her anxiously what you should do more i've looked down into a little boy's face and she imagined this older kid terrorizing him and she really really tried to give her usual advice that you should never ever hit anyone did i mention more i was from glasgow anyway anyway she ended up saying look you should never hit people and she took a big breath but if you ever do have to hit someone darling make it a cracker so like morag i do not advocate violence i'm a professor of english i mean you take this story on a purely metaphorical level alright metaphor so with that in mind class of 2020 if life ever puts you in the kind of intolerable position where all negotiation and compromise has failed and you have no other recourse but to throw a metaphorical punch remember your scottish training make it a cracker right right huge congratulations to you all the resilient class of 2020 and to the families who supported you all through it as well enjoy your time back in saint andrews this week and go party you've earned it OK in order to do that please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti said kumon nebus nobis in secular secularism amen",

Good afternoon everyone. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduate serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the way in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history, but creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learnt primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors, often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics all inspired by Aristotle. Speaking in the vernacular was forbidden, and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in Latin, which remained our official institutional language until 1747. Examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by one's professors. And discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century St. Andrews as too distracting. But archery an important skill for the defence of the realm, was promoted. This may have occasion second thoughts in 1470, when after an unresolved argument the Dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows. Student life in St. Leonards College. Over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university. Founded within a religious capital. Students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six. Started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continued to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly prohibited less. They like football, should prove too distracting, with the exception of a single laundress. And on the condition that she was over 50 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Adam Ferguson, a renowned Enlightenment philosopher, graduated in 1742. James Wilson, a founding father of the United States, studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD or Doctor of Medicine by the university, the French Revolutionary Jean Paul Marat in 1775 and in 1792 Edward Jenner, whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox. I need modern immunology. By the beginning of the 1800s, Saint Andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. A healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by way of the University Scotland Act of 1858 introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day. Women were admitted to full-time study in 1892 and by the 1900s student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences. Perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of September 1911, which resemble our activities. Today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties were spread across the town. Speeches were delivered. Representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed. A student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the Bell Pettigrew Museum, and the town came to life with song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in July. In June 1929 its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model. In honor of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors. It is therefore sight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better. As so many have done before them. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears. The first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and I am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities. 2 years later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in July 2020, and thus the graduation ritual. Will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred, with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time. The graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I will use to confirm the degrees, will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards that bachelors, masters, and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties, and I will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirmed the degree of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP. To most though, I will simply say at Super Tay's meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews Taylor, and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our theaters Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Sir Kenneth Dalgleish MBE. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is professor Rhiannon Purdy from the School of English. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your achievements, but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present that the degree of Doctor of Laws on all risk causa Sir Kenneth Matheson Dalgleish. So Kenneth is quite simply a footballing legend and one of Scotland's greatest ever sports people. He was also personally responsible for what my 11 year old self considered the best day of her life in 1986 when he scored the only goal against Chelsea in the last game of the season, securing Liverpool Football Club League and Cup double. So Kenneth or King Kenny is he's perhaps better known to generations of football fans. Was born and brought up in Glasgow. Despite starting out as a goalkeeper, he excelled as a striker. During his playing career, he made over 850 appearances for Liverpool and Celtic, scoring 345 goals. He was part of teams that won three European Cups, a European Super Cup 10 league championships and multiple Scottish and English Cups and League Cups. He's Scotland's most capped player with 102 appearances. And their joint equal top goal scorer with 30 goals. Although I was warned by my head of school not to mention a particularly painful one in 1976 against Ray Clements in England. In 2020 he was voted by fans of Scotland's greatest international footballer. So kind of there's also had a successful career as a manager, initially with livable with whom he won another three league championships. He's been inducted into the Scottish and English Football Halls of Fame, and in 1985 he was awarded an MBE for his services to football. It is noteworthy, however, that although the citation for his knighthood with which he was honoured in 2018, mentions these footballing achievements. It highlights his charity work and wider service to the City of Liverpool. The charity he founded in 2004, jointly with his wife Marina. I'm very pleased to say also joins us here today. Has raised many millions of pounds to support the treatment of and research into cancer. With two Liverpool hospitals, Aintree and Broadgreen being particular beneficiaries so Kenneth was manager of Liverpool during one of the club's darkest days, the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 which recently claimed its 97th victim. While the rights and wrongs of the events that day were played out on the front of tabloid newspapers and ultimately in the courts. So Kenneth, of course was on the ground supporting his players, visiting the injured and the families of those who had lost loved ones and attending the funerals of all who had died. His selfless and unwavering support for the families and communities of the city in the most difficult of times will never be forgotten. When I was asked to give this address, I asked my colleagues, family and friends for advice. It was noticeable that everybody had a Kenny story, how they'd met him, how they mannered, met him, how a particular game or goal had made, or for some others completely devastated a season for them. Let me though the most telling comment came from my mum. Who, despite living in a family of Liverpool fans is about as uninterested in football as it's possible to be. On hearing that, I would be speaking here today, she said. Kenny Dalglish you don't like him. I think he was quite good. High praise indeed. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to football to charity and to wider society, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris councillor on Sir Kenneth Dalgleish. Tay Edgardo Doctoris Legum honoris causa promoviendo kuyas 3IN symbolum superette hope berekum imponer. Congratulations again. Vice chancellor that says no one in my 40s standing up to speak but. I think it's only right when somebody gives you a huge. Presentation. That you say at least thank you and for me. Marina and I have lived in England longer than we've both lived in Scotland. But that's not what you say that. That means then. Anyways, this. Obviously, boy growing up in Glasgow and it was either he followed the gun culture or you you could run fast, but fortunately I could run fast so I escaped a bit of trouble and. Whatever there that we were brought up to, he be respectful of people. The respectful of people's position and life. And. Probably brought up to be fortunate that. We could go on with life. My parents were fantastically supportive. Of myself when I was playing football as a as a wee boy, football unlike the university you mentioned earlier, never banned football in their house. We had. We had great times with the football. Your dad takes you to the football. You go and play. Your dad comes in watching when you play and you just. Goes through here and through your veins. The physician must still report you have been thankful that the abiba, an idea how he played football, but I wasn't coming here to do exactly what you did. And congratulations to the the people we've all had their graduation presentations today, but I was never getting anywhere near that. That way we passed my 11 plus, but that was a bit. But for me it was football and throughout the year. You're you're older years, he he played develop and I was forced. Now that I played with. To or under the to the most successful managers and in British football jobs team. And Bob Beasley. For me it was a. It was easy. To play the success that I had. There's no one individual sport. It's a team sport and. Irrespective of whether you made a contribution, which would be nice. And think maybe abused the privilege that it was a team sport by no making the contribution too often. It was. It was all about us. It wasn't about me and I think in life that's the way that you've got the you've got to to yourself forward. 74 married Marina it was very nice of her. They proposed to me. And. That was just. Well. For me it was a no brainer for Marina. I think you took a bit of persuasion, but four children later. And me at exactly where our parents wanted us to be. Consider it for other people. Respectful of other people and. If you can't do somebody a favor, I don't see any reason why we should do them a bad turn. So unfortunately, between the year ago Marina fell out. And we started off the charity which was. The way it was seen. Thank you to the people who had looked after us in the hospital and. But it was we were there. I thought maybe a little bit late to do something for the charity for the the hospital if we could help. And I thought maybe it'd be a game, a goal for, or something that they could play. And they said we've got the 5th floor. Of the hospital that used to be a maternity ward that has been closed down and. Bit late to renovate that into a chemotherapy ward. I felt, well, I don't think a game of golf will cover that course. So we say our. The charity and it's it's not your money, it's. Marina working at it. Diligently, the our daughters working at it as well. The fact Lauren and the youngest one. She runs it and I just do them, told so whatever they tell me, it's done and it's helping people. Tremendously and in Liverpool and also we did stuff up in Glasgow as well. So for me it's a that's about your life and it's great that you have all got your. Your certificates are qualification and I hope and I'm sure you will put them to good use and for me the greatest memory is to remember and help people less fortunate than yourself. This is greatly appreciated. Thank you. I call upon Professor Rhiannon Purdy of the School of English. Tell you what. It's not easier to come up here and follow King Kenny, but. Vice Chancellor's colleagues special guests and graduates you'll be glad to know there's 4 minutes left. Now here's a statement that the graduation address never normally starts with. Welcome back. Normally the point of a graduation address is to wave and cheer on behalf of the university as we launch you into the world. But for you, the class of 2020, the world was suddenly turned on its head during the final few weeks of your degrees. With global COVID-19 pandemic, we all found ourselves locked up, pixelating and stuttering through the remaining classes online. I know you remember it all too well. You got through strange final assessments online, only to realize that the graduation celebrations which your previous four or five years have been leading up to would have to be postponed. Maybe you envied the class of 2021, whose graduation obviously wouldn't be blighted, cause of course the pandemic would be long gone by then. Now, next I would normally say something once sentimental and vaguely threatening, like you might not realise it yet. But Saint Andrews has become part of you. You will find yourself inexorably drawn back to visit this place where you became an adult, but you've already been out in the rough and tumble of the world for two years, and you've come back. You know this as a simple fact. You also probably don't need the kinds of advice we normally offer at a starry, starry eyed new graduates, but I'm an academic and I pontificate to audiences for a living. I'm like that annoying elderly Aunt who corners you at a wedding reception when you just want a party with everybody else. So I'm gonna plow ahead and I'm going to give you some advice, right? So the first thing is something my father told me when I was agonizing over whether or not to come back and do a PhD. Clearly, you know, spoiler alert. I was teaching English in Japan at the time, which was huge, fun and very difficult to give up. I worried about the kind of debt I would rack up if I went back to studying. I fretted about how old I'd be almost 30 before I finished. And I could embark on a sort of grown up career of some kind. At last I thought my father would have an opinion one way or the other, and I was all set to argue about it. Whatever it was. But he just said, well, you know, the real difficulty in life isn't doing things. It's figuring out your priorities. You can't do or have everything. So which is the thing you most want and that you'll sacrifice other things for if necessary? That's the difficult call to make. Once you've made it, the rest is just admin. So just admin might oversimplify things a little bit, but I have found this advice genuinely useful, so I pass it on to you in the hopes that you will too. The second, slightly more controversial piece of advice comes from my friend, let's call her Morag. Many years ago, when our sons were in primary school together, her son was getting bullied by an older boy who was really starting to knock him about. Now, Morag had always taught her sons that hitting people was wrong. The violence was never the answer. You talk things out etcetera, but talking just wasn't working with this bully and her son asked her anxiously what you should do. More I've looked down into a little boy's face and she imagined this older kid terrorizing him and she really, really tried to give her usual advice that you should never, ever hit anyone. Did I mention more? I was from Glasgow. Anyway, anyway she ended up saying, look, you should never hit people. And she took a big breath. But if you ever do have to hit someone darling, make it a cracker. So, like Morag, I do not advocate violence. I'm a professor of English. I mean you take this story on a purely metaphorical level. Alright metaphor. So with that in mind, class of 2020, if life ever puts you in the kind of intolerable position where all negotiation and compromise has failed and you have no other recourse but to throw a metaphorical punch. Remember your Scottish training? Make it a cracker, right right? Huge congratulations to you all the resilient class of 2020 and to the families who supported you all through it as well. Enjoy your time back in Saint Andrews this week and go party. You've earned it. OK, in order to do that, please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, said Kumon Nebus nobis in secular secularism, Amen."
