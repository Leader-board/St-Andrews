graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the angle hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the universities foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later of the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king robert the third and later as tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for eighteen years king james revisited saint andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas here in fourteen twenty five and he was so enamoured by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the sixth of scotland and first of england visited saint andrews in sixteen seventeen and made a gift of two hundred volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in sixteen forty three on south street this was a key moment for the early library but one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary 's college from fifteen eighty and rector from fifteen ninety melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen 's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony very much like this one in two thousand and five we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may twenty twenty one and earlier this month we unveiled a fortieth birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the universities wardlaw museum our recently redeveloped museum situated on the schools which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fife to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is one from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our vetus chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudi armours and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i'm invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that powercity of quintessential festivities two years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july twenty twenty and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or beratung touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of the university medal upon today's guest of honour roger thompson to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor anthony lang from the school of international relations the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artist art seum vice chancellor i asked you to confirm the degree of master of arts general on arrivera bola tay adrada magistri artsiom confirmo curious ray in symbolum superette

thompson for the university medal roger thompson is an outstanding individual whose selfless support of the university of saint andrews over three decades has been transformative in the lives of hundreds of students in nineteen eighty nine roger pioneered the creation of a fund to support an exchange between the university of saint andrews and universities in canada in nineteen ninety two the canadian robert T jones junior scholarship began financing transatlantic transatlantic student exchanges initially between saint andrews and western university ontario and from nineteen ninety six also with queens university with roger serving as the first chair of the foundation the foundation commemorates one of the greatest ever golfers bobby jones who won thirteen of the world 's foremost golf championships at the age of twenty eight and in nineteen fifty eight was given the freedom of the city of saint andrews in this hall inspired by the preexisting robert T jones scholarship with emory university in atlanta roger sought to establish a canadian equivalent of the programme for three main reasons first to foster international collaboration and friendships second to honour the history of the of the san andreas and of golf and third most importantly to provide students with a life changing experience and an enriching education to enabling them to succeed both while at university and beyond canadian bobby jones scholars are selected based upon their strength of their academic attainment and personal statement not engulfing skill successful applicants have their tuition fees waived and they receive a scholarship to cover all living expenses in this way the foundation ensures that the most promising students are granted this opportunity regardless of their background or previous experience with the sport one past recipient of scholarship enabling an exchange with queens university in ontario was susan stewart now director of the open university in scotland susan was the scottish government 's first secretary for scottish affairs at the UK embassy in washington DC in two thousand and one a role that she directly attributes to her time spent studying abroad describing her year at queen 's university she writes i hadn't been on a plane before flying to toronto to study at queens university and that year transformed my life it was the beginning of a lifelong love affair with canada and kingston a year later i returned to saint andrews much more intellectually confident and with a more rounded perspective and i was always be grateful to saint andrews not only for the first class education i received but for the opportunities to study abroad which i would never have been able to do without their generous scholarships roger has been heavily involved with facilitating such educational experiences since the foundation was established today the foundation 's assets are in excess of five million canadian dollars and this astonishing some is owed to rogers diplomacy and service in championing the scholarship to which he is also a significant donor the time that he has spent soliciting donations and increasing financial reserves will ensure that students will enjoy and benefit from the scholarship for many years to come in addition to the almost three hundred and fifty students who have already done so his desire to support the university extends wider still and roger was a donor to the canada room as part of the refurbishment of the students association building during the six hundredth anniversary campaign roger has been a consistent supporter of the university of saint andrews for the past thirty years working not only with the current principle but her three predecessors vice chancellor in recognition of his accomplishments as a benefactor to the university of saint andrews and to mark three decades of support to the canadian robert P jones junior scholarship i ask you to present the university medal to roger thompson i call upon professor anthony lang of the school of international relations vice chancellor 's colleagues special guests and graduates first and most importantly to you graduates congratulations i realize as we all do on this stage that these words are long overdue to you you were the first class to deal with the pandemic which took away what should have been the culmination of your academic life here at saint andrews it is certainly wonderful to see you here for this celebration late as it is now one of the things you'll sometimes hear at graduation ceremonies is what kind of rules you should have for life or what rules to follow when you enter the real world you might remember that your teachers here at saint andrews instilled in you various kinds of rules how to do research the ethics of investigation the scientific method textual interpretation good writing careful analysis and general scholarly sensibility we academics like rules in fact as you could see from this graduation ceremony there are rules about how we ought to dress length of our robes color our robes i can assure my colleagues who make it asked to do this address in the future you don't there's no rule that says you have to dress like a bumblebee to give the graduation dress but there are lots of other rules you had to learn ones that none of us expected when to wear a mask when to eat together when to drink together when to get tested what to do when you wanted to travel how far apart you should stand the rules or guidelines or regulations or laws we were never sure what they should be called prevented shaking hands or hugging a friend or having classes in person all the things that make university life normal slowly disappear and other kinds of rules seem to be breaking now too when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year they violated one of the central rules of the international order but it's not just russia one of the most cited reasons for brexit was that the rules and regulations coming from the european union were somehow hampering the british economy and society and during the presidency of donald trump the idea that no rules or international laws should bind the united states became a rallying cry for many now living in a world without rules or where the rules are changing can be scary it could even be deadly as the people of ukraine are now experiencing in my field of international relations there are voices calling for a return to a rules based international order or a return to normalcy but perhaps the rules we had were not fit for purpose that rules based order allowed great powers to undertake humanitarian interventions which never seem that helpful as the ignominious withdrawal from afghanistan has recently demonstrated the neoliberalism of the global economy with rules made by those who make the most money has greatly increased global and quality our inability to formulate global responses to climate change and the pandemic reveal most clearly the empty promise of our contemporary rules based order now my favorite political theorist hannah arendt wrote in nineteen fifty four that to understand changing politics in her case the emergence of totalitarianism means we need to think without a banister certainly she worried about the loss of those banisters those rules and standards of judgments that made sense of the world but she recognized that the existing rules were problematic she believed the collapse of those banisters could be an opportunity an opportunity to think creatively and courageously about what comes next i hate to tell you this but that's your job now to think to understand and as a result to create new rules for a new world you were taught how to think here i hope and some of the rules we have given you i hope will help you in that task but we need you to create new standards and new rules ones that protect the weak and bind the powerful we need you to create a world in which we can live together without violence and with justice now perhaps you've been doing it already so keep it up if you have if not think about how you might do that in the future we your teachers know you can do it we're counting on you so good luck please stand for the benediction gratia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen",

proximity to lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony very much like this one in 2005 we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may 2021 and earlier this month we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the universities wardlaw museum our recently redeveloped museum situated on the schools which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fife to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is 1 from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our vetus chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudi armours and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i'm invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that powercity of quintessential festivities 2 years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july 2020 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or beratung touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of the university medal upon today's guest of honour roger thompson to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor anthony lang from the school of international relations the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your

robert fleming vice chancellor it is my privilege to present roger thompson for the university medal roger thompson is an outstanding individual whose selfless support of the university of saint andrews over 3 decades has been transformative in the lives of hundreds of students in 1989 roger pioneered the creation of a fund to support an exchange between the university of saint andrews and universities in canada in 1992 the canadian robert T jones junior scholarship began financing transatlantic transatlantic student exchanges initially between saint andrews and western university ontario and from 1996 also with queens university with roger serving as the first chair of the foundation the foundation commemorates one of the greatest ever golfers bobby jones who won 13 of the world's foremost golf championships at the age of 28 and in 1958 was given the freedom of the city of saint andrews in this hall inspired by the preexisting robert T jones scholarship with emory university in atlanta roger sought to establish a canadian equivalent of the programme for three main reasons first to foster international collaboration and friendships second to honour the history of the of the san andreas and of golf and third most importantly to provide students with a life changing experience and an enriching education to enabling them to succeed both while at university and beyond canadian bobby jones scholars are selected based upon their strength of their academic attainment and personal statement not engulfing skill successful applicants have their tuition fees waived and they receive a scholarship to cover all living expenses in this way the foundation ensures that the most promising students are granted this opportunity regardless of their background or previous experience with the sport one past recipient of scholarship enabling an exchange with queens university in ontario was susan stewart now director of the open university in scotland susan was the scottish government's first secretary for scottish affairs at the UK embassy in washington DC in 2001 a role that she directly attributes to her time spent studying abroad describing her year at queen's university she writes i hadn't been on a plane before flying to toronto to study at queens university and that year transformed my life it was the beginning of a lifelong love affair with canada and kingston a year later i returned to saint andrews much more intellectually confident and with a more rounded perspective and i was always be grateful to saint andrews not only for the first class education i received but for the opportunities to study abroad which i would never have been able to do without their generous scholarships roger has been heavily involved with facilitating such educational experiences since the foundation was established today the foundation's assets are in excess of 5,000,000 canadian dollars and this astonishing some is owed to rogers diplomacy and service in championing the scholarship to which he is also a significant donor the time that he has spent soliciting donations and increasing financial reserves will ensure that students will enjoy and benefit from the scholarship for many years to come in addition to the almost 350 students who have already done so his desire to support the university extends wider still and roger was a donor to the canada room as part of the refurbishment of the students association building during the 600th anniversary campaign roger has been a consistent supporter of the university of saint andrews for the past 30 years working not only with the current principle but her three predecessors vice chancellor in recognition of his accomplishments as a benefactor to the university of saint andrews and to mark 3 decades of support to the canadian robert P jones junior scholarship i ask you to present the university medal to roger thompson i call upon professor anthony lang of the school of international relations vice chancellor's colleagues special guests and graduates 1st and most importantly to you graduates congratulations i realize as we all do on this stage that these words are long overdue to you you were the first class to deal with the pandemic which took away what should have been the culmination of your academic life here at saint andrews it is certainly wonderful to see you here for this celebration late as it is now one of the things you'll sometimes hear at graduation ceremonies is what kind of rules you should have for life or what rules to follow when you enter the real world you might remember that your teachers here at saint andrews instilled in you various kinds of rules how to do research the ethics of investigation the scientific method textual interpretation good writing careful analysis and general scholarly sensibility we academics like rules in fact as you could see from this graduation ceremony there are rules about how we ought to dress length of our robes color our robes i can assure my colleagues who make it asked to do this address in the future you don't there's no rule that says you have to dress like a bumblebee to give the graduation dress but there are lots of other rules you had to learn ones that none of us expected when to wear a mask when to eat together when to drink together when to get tested what to do when you wanted to travel how far apart you should stand the rules or guidelines or regulations or laws we were never sure what they should be called prevented shaking hands or hugging a friend or having classes in person all the things that make university life normal slowly disappear and other kinds of rules seem to be breaking now too when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year they violated one of the central rules of the international order but it's not just russia one of the most cited reasons for brexit was that the rules and regulations coming from the european union were somehow hampering the british economy and society and during the presidency of donald trump the idea that no rules or international laws should bind the united states became a rallying cry for many now living in a world without rules or where the rules are changing can be scary it could even be deadly as the people of ukraine are now experiencing in my field of international relations there are voices calling for a return to a rules based international order or a return to normalcy but perhaps the rules we had were not fit for purpose that rules based order allowed great powers to undertake humanitarian interventions which never seem that helpful as the ignominious withdrawal from afghanistan has recently demonstrated the neoliberalism of the global economy with rules made by those who make the most money has greatly increased global and quality our inability to formulate global responses to climate change and the pandemic reveal most clearly the empty promise of our contemporary rules based order now my favorite political theorist hannah arendt wrote in 1954 that to understand changing politics in her case the emergence of totalitarianism means we need to think without a banister certainly she worried about the loss of those banisters those rules and standards of judgments that made sense of the world but she recognized that the existing rules were problematic she believed the collapse of those banisters could be an opportunity an opportunity to think creatively and courageously about what comes next i hate to tell you this but that's your job now to think to understand and as a result to create new rules for a new world you were taught how to think here i hope and some of the rules we have given you i hope will help you in that task but we need you to create new standards and new rules ones that protect the weak and bind the powerful we need you to create a world in which we can live together without violence and with justice now perhaps you've been doing it already so keep it up if you have if not think about how you might do that in the future we your teachers know you can do it we're counting on you so good luck please stand for the benediction gratia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen",

It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer's graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the angle hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural and intellectual development since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the Universities Foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. The royal leaders of Scotland and later of the United Kingdom have been a guiding, enriching and at times challenging presence in our history. Saint Andrews was the spiritual home of Scotland and on occasion hosted the Scottish Court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the Royal household. Our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, served as an adviser and diplomat to King Robert the 3rd and later as tutor and Protector to his son, the future King James, the first of Scotland, who resided with him in Saint Andrews Castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to France. Which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in England for 18 years. King James Revisited St. Andrews throughout his life celebrating Christmas here in 1425 and he was so enamoured by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to Perth. His request was dutifully and happily ignored. Our university library, the oldest continuous library in Scotland, is indebted to royal patronage. King James, the 6th of Scotland and 1st of England visited St. Andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the University Library. A building in his honour to accommodate this collection, the King James Library was completed in 1643 on South St. This was a key moment for the early library, but one suspects that King James was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign. King James clashed repeatedly with Andrew Melville, a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as Principal of Saint Mary's College from 1580 and rector from 1590. Melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university, but was resistant to royal interference. Given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether, King James locked Melville in the Tower of London. Royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to Lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence. We enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating Her Majesty the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. We have been honoured by the presence of Her Majesty periodically throughout her reign, most recently at the graduation of our alumni, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a graduation ceremony. Very much like this one in 2005 we were delighted to welcome their Royal Highnesses back to the university for a visit. In May 2021 and earlier this month, we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge at the Universities Wardlaw Museum. Our recently redeveloped museum, situated on the schools, which is well worth a visit. In crossing today's stage, each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps, but also in the footsteps of the academics, leaders and Changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of Fife to shape the world in profound ways. The journey you make from here is yours to envisage, but their example is 1, from which we can all draw inspiration. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Vetus Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudi armours and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and I'm invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that powercity of quintessential festivities. 2 years later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in July 2020, and thus the graduation ritual. Will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred? This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I will use to confirm the degrees, will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties, and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirmed the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP. To most though, I will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or beratung touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our veterans Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of the University medal upon today's guest of honour. Roger Thompson. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Professor Anthony Lang from the School of International Relations. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments, but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

Roger Thompson is an outstanding individual whose selfless support of the University of Saint Andrews over 3 decades has been transformative in the lives of hundreds of students. In 1989, Roger pioneered the creation of a fund to support an exchange between the University of Saint Andrews and universities in Canada. In 1992, the Canadian Robert T Jones Junior Scholarship began financing transatlantic transatlantic student exchanges. Initially between Saint Andrews and Western University, Ontario and from 1996, also with Queens University with Roger serving as the first chair of the Foundation. The foundation commemorates one of the greatest ever golfers, Bobby Jones, who won 13 of the world's foremost golf championships at the age of 28 and in 1958, was given the freedom of the city of Saint Andrews in this hall. Inspired by the preexisting Robert T Jones scholarship with Emory University in Atlanta. Roger sought to establish a Canadian equivalent of the programme for three main reasons. First, to foster international collaboration and friendships. Second to honour, the history of the of the San Andreas and of golf and third, most importantly, to provide students with a life changing experience and an enriching education to enabling them to succeed both while at university and beyond. Canadian Bobby Jones scholars are selected based upon their strength of their academic attainment and personal statement, not engulfing skill. Successful applicants have their tuition fees waived and they receive a scholarship to cover all living expenses. In this way, the foundation ensures that the most promising students are granted this opportunity, regardless of their background or previous experience with the sport. One past recipient of scholarship enabling an exchange with Queens University in Ontario was Susan Stewart, now director of the Open University in Scotland. Susan was the Scottish Government's first secretary for Scottish affairs at the UK Embassy in Washington DC in 2001, a role that she directly attributes to her time spent studying abroad, describing her year at Queen's University. She writes, I hadn't been on a plane before flying to Toronto to study at Queens University, and that year transformed my life. It was the beginning of a lifelong love affair with Canada and Kingston. A year later I returned to Saint Andrews much more intellectually confident and with a more rounded perspective, and I was always be grateful to Saint Andrews, not only for the first class education I received, but for the opportunities to study abroad, which I would never have been able to do without their generous scholarships. Roger has been heavily involved with facilitating such educational experiences since the foundation was established today. The Foundation's assets are in excess of 5,000,000 Canadian dollars, and this astonishing some is owed to Rogers Diplomacy and service. In championing the scholarship to which he is also a significant donor. The time that he has spent soliciting donations and increasing financial reserves will ensure that students will enjoy and benefit from the scholarship for many years to come. In addition to the almost 350 students who have already done so, his desire to support the university extends wider still. And Roger was a donor to the Canada Room as part of the refurbishment of the Students Association building during the 600th anniversary campaign. Roger has been a consistent supporter of the University of Saint Andrews for the past 30 years, working not only with the current principle, but her three predecessors. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his accomplishments as a benefactor to the University of Saint Andrews. And to Mark 3 decades of support to the Canadian Robert P. Jones Junior Scholarship, I ask you to present the University medal to Roger Thompson. I call upon Professor Anthony Lang of the School of International Relations. Vice Chancellor's colleagues special guests and graduates. 1st and most importantly to you graduates congratulations. I realize as we all do on this stage that these words are long overdue to you. You were the first class to deal with the pandemic, which took away what should have been the culmination of your academic life here at Saint Andrews. It is certainly wonderful to see you here for this celebration late as it is. Now, one of the things you'll sometimes hear at graduation ceremonies is what kind of rules you should have for life or what rules to follow when you enter the real world. You might remember that your teachers here at Saint Andrews instilled in you various kinds of rules how to do research, the ethics of investigation, the scientific method, textual interpretation, good writing, careful analysis, and general scholarly sensibility. We academics like rules. In fact, as you could see from this graduation ceremony, there are rules about how we ought to dress, length of our robes color our robes. I can assure my colleagues who make it asked to do this address in the future. You don't. There's no rule that says you have to dress like a bumblebee to give the graduation dress. But there are lots of other rules you had to learn, ones that none of us expected. When to wear a mask, when to eat together, when to drink together, when to get tested, what to do when you wanted to travel? How far apart you should stand. The rules or guidelines or regulations or laws we were never sure what they should be called, prevented shaking hands or hugging a friend or having classes in person. All the things that make university life normal slowly disappear. And other kinds of rules seem to be breaking now too. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February of this year, they violated one of the central rules of the international order. But it's not just Russia. One of the most cited reasons for Brexit was that the rules and regulations coming from the European Union were somehow hampering the British economy and society. And during the presidency of Donald Trump, the idea that no rules or international laws should bind the United States became a rallying cry for many. Now, living in a world without rules or where the rules are changing can be scary. It could even be deadly as the people of Ukraine are now experiencing. In my field of international relations, there are voices calling for a return to a rules based international order or a return to normalcy. But perhaps the rules we had were not fit for purpose. That rules based order allowed great powers to undertake humanitarian interventions, which never seem that helpful, as the ignominious withdrawal from Afghanistan has recently demonstrated the neoliberalism of the global economy with rules made by those who make the most money has greatly increased global and quality. Our inability to formulate global responses to climate change and the pandemic reveal most clearly the empty promise of our contemporary rules based order. Now my favorite political theorist, Hannah Arendt wrote in 1954 that to understand changing politics in her case, the emergence of totalitarianism. Means we need to think without a banister. Certainly she worried about the loss of those banisters, those rules and standards of judgments that made sense of the world. But she recognized that the existing rules were problematic. She believed the collapse of those banisters could be an opportunity. An opportunity to think creatively and courageously about what comes next. I hate to tell you this, but that's your job now. To think, to understand and as a result, to create new rules for a new world. You were taught how to think here, I hope, and some of the rules we have given you I hope will help you in that task. But we need you to create new standards and new rules, ones that protect the weak and bind the powerful. We need you to create a world in which we can live together without violence and with justice. Now, perhaps you've been doing it already, so keep it up if you have. If not, think about how you might do that in the future. We, your teachers, know you can do it. We're counting on you. So good luck. Please stand for the benediction. Gratia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen."
