good afternoon everyone it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and love bombs in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july two thousand and nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalized this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations being refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a center for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later of the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king robert the third and later as tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for eighteen years king james revisited saint andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas here in fourteen twenty five and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the sixth of scotland and first of england visited saint andrews in sixteen seventeen and made a gift of two hundred volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in sixteen forty three on south street this was a key moment for the early library but one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary's college from fifteen eighty and as rector from fifteen ninety melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen 's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony rather like this one in two thousand and five we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may twenty twenty one and earlier this month we unveiled a fortieth birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the universities wardlaw museum our recently redevelop museum situated on the schools which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fife to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is one from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor it is my pleasure to welcome you all after which the confirmation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities two years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july twenty twenty and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latter in which the chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our vators chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire in his hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion the choir will today be conducted by doctor michael downes director of music we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of the university medal upon today's guest of honour mister david mcclure due to the indisposition of the academic registrar mary noel early i will deliver the citation address on behalf of the university to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is the assistant vice principal dean of arts and divinity professor paul hibbert the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean

university chancellor it is my privilege to present david mcclure for the university medal dave mcclure started his professional career as an engineer working on nuclear sites at junrey and hunterston B before being drawn to a career in teaching teaching mathematics in year in nineteen seventy five was the start of a forty five year career teaching young people in nine schools across scotland quickly moving through principal teacher positions dave was appointed deputy rector at buck haven high school in leaven in two thousand and one following a difficult HM IE inspection including one of the worst reports ever written although dave acting as rector at the time received one of the few positive comments he was subsequently appointed rector in two thousand and three on the day of the interview staff were invited into the assembly hall and when it was announced that he had been appointed they let off party poppers cheering and stamping their feet i knew that they were part of something special his clear vision and ability to bring stuff with him on his journey inspired everyone one of his colleagues told us that when he stood and addressed the staff they would have followed him into battle the following year a glowing HMI report identified dave 's leadership as the foundation on which improvements in attendance behaviour and attainment were built articles in the herald the BBC and the times praised his leadership and approach to improvement across the school characteristically dave attributes this turnaround of buck haven to the hard work and perseverance of the staff and pupils rather than himself in two thousand five however he was invited to meet the prime minister tony blair in recognition of his impact at the school and then again in two thousand and six as one of just ten head teachers across the UK for a one to one meeting to recognise his and the schools ongoing success in two thousand and thirteen five education services asked him to take up the post of rector at madras college beyond the rigours of developing and delivering the curriculum one of his first challenges was supporting the relocation and integration within the school community of army families from falling bostel in germany who had just arrived at lucas dave was heavily involved with five education services to design the new madras college in its site at bilbray on the western edge of saint andrews and in supporting the transition of the south street buildings to the university which will soon become the university 's new college at madras dave developed a strong community and improved outcomes for all pupils attainment in qualifications improved significantly with the school highly ranked in scotland for achievements in five hires alongside academic excellence dave was committed to improving outcomes for every pupil with a curriculum where wider achievement opportunities were built-in across the school rather than as an added element one of his proudest achievements was securing a very good HMI inspection report in twenty fifteen cited as demonstrating an ethos of learning for all and raising attainment every year he also reorganised the school day to safeguard the curriculum in the face of quite draconian financial cuts substantial and inspired solutions were required to accommodate these cuts but the breadth of curriculum and quality of teaching remain his legacy dave was keenly involved in outreach activities at buck haven and madras supporting the first chances project with the university he was also a strong supporter of the university 's communication and teaching in science module which gives students training in communicating in classroom settings and experience of working with school pupils even giving lectures to students before they went out into schools but first and foremost dave was a maths teacher he never lost his enthusiasm for his subject and loved to explore its applications fascinated by the pedagogy of mathematics he had very clear ideas on the most effective ways to teach it and was even clearer when education scotland seemed to be diverging from the path of mathematical righteousness his commitment to his subject remained throughout his career teaching mathematics each week for every one of his forty five years into his seventies it would be remiss not to mention the support of day's wife liz throughout his career from enrolling three of their five children at nursery in order to teach maths alongside dave when buck haven 's reputation made it hard to attract teachers to the double act at madras with dave striding around the quad dealing with non blazer wearing rebels while liz sat in the guidance base with those struggling to attend supporting them through qualifications dave maintains it was a privilege to work with the staff pupils communities and partners he met in his career managing the challenges of change while always keeping to the fore the core value of delivering a quality education in all of its aspects to all of his pupils in support of the community this commitment to every one of his students elicits comments from pupils parents and colleagues such as brilliant he put his heart and soul into that place would have been there forever if he could he loved madras everything about it and everyone like superman inspirational and extraordinary leader i could have spent my entire time here reading out similar comments from people across his professional career a clear testament to the impact davis had on so many people chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to the education of young people in saint andrews and across scotland and the key role he has played in the relationship between madras college and the university i invite you to present david mcclure with the university medal we're concerned problem i call that one professor paul hibbert the dean of arts and divinity professor hubert chancellor colleagues special guests and graduates my friends it's usual in this kind of speech for older folk like me to try and raise the aspirations of younger folk and those young at heart whose graduations we are celebrating we move swiftly from praising your terrific abilities and superlative achievements to setting out a list of modest challenges like ending hunger or achieving world peace or discovering the meaning of life no pressure well the time between your graduation and your return here today has been hard enough without all of that so instead i'm going to do you a favor by completing one of those challenges for you today i'm going to tell you the meaning of life now we might be tempted to look up into a clear moonless night under the light of a hundred billion galaxies and look for meaning through the lens of science science is making good progress in establishing the simple laws that govern the universe but as impressive as it is it's not what things mean it's simply how things work or we might seek to grow rich enough to have a hundred billion dollars and shoot our ego into the sky in a suspiciously shaped rocket but that's just vanity and doesn't mean anything and if you get there you'll find it's nothing but space man the truth is you can't find the meaning of life through scientific or literal exploration even if it takes you beyond the earth this is because meaning isn't a discoverable thing instead it's something that is made for example in our unimaginably vast universe as far as we know we're the only creatures looking up into the stars and making stories about the constellations we imagine we have filled the sky with heroes and mythical beasts it's in the nature of human creativity to make meaning and that meaning does not depend on cold facts or on our physical limitations on this planet we exceed those limitations through our creation of meaningful culture in art in writing in music and in so many other fields we also create meaningful work in science education industry and public service and through that create the resources and opportunities for everyone to flourish and participate but everything doesn't have to be on a grand scale we also make meaning in moments of laughter amongst friends in clever conversation in unexpected generous kindness that thwarts greed and oh oh in the blessed mystery of love i suspect that most graduates here today will have returned in part because of memories of times like those you already know how meaningful they are therefore the answer to the question what is the meaning of life at least human life is this it's up to us it's up to you you've already shown yourselves to be awesome students and graduates in the most difficult of times you now have the chance to make the most of all of your possibilities and potential on your own terms so in closing i wish you every success in making meaning in the way that works best for you whether in art education science industry or public service as you do so i hope you continue to make friendships that bring inspiration and laughter and share with someone what it means to love and be loved you deserve nothing less and i wish you all the best of luck please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism ahmed",

cambridge at the universities wardlaw museum our recently redevelop museum situated on the schools which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fife to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is 1 from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor it is my pleasure to welcome you all after which the confirmation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence this ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities 2 years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july 2020 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latter in which the chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our vators chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire in his hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion the choir will today be conducted by doctor michael downes director of music we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of the university medal upon today's guest of honour mr david mcclure due to the indisposition of the academic registrar mary noel early i will deliver the citation address on behalf of the university to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is the assistant vice principal dean of arts and divinity professor paul hibbert the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the

principle of the university chancellor it is my privilege to present david mcclure for the university medal dave mcclure started his professional career as an engineer working on nuclear sites at junrey and hunterston B before being drawn to a career in teaching teaching mathematics in year in 1975 was the start of a 45 year career teaching young people in nine schools across scotland quickly moving through principal teacher positions dave was appointed deputy rector at buck haven high school in leaven in 2001 following a difficult HM IE inspection including one of the worst reports ever written although dave acting as rector at the time received one of the few positive comments he was subsequently appointed rector in 2003 on the day of the interview staff were invited into the assembly hall and when it was announced that he had been appointed they let off party poppers cheering and stamping their feet i knew that they were part of something special his clear vision and ability to bring stuff with him on his journey inspired everyone one of his colleagues told us that when he stood and addressed the staff they would have followed him into battle the following year a glowing HMI report identified dave's leadership as the foundation on which improvements in attendance behaviour and attainment were built articles in the herald the BBC and the times praised his leadership and approach to improvement across the school characteristically dave attributes this turnaround of buck haven to the hard work and perseverance of the staff and pupils rather than himself in 2005 however he was invited to meet the prime minister tony blair in recognition of his impact at the school and then again in 2006 as one of just 10 head teachers across the UK for a one to one meeting to recognise his and the schools ongoing success in 2013 five education services asked him to take up the post of rector at madras college beyond the rigours of developing and delivering the curriculum one of his first challenges was supporting the relocation and integration within the school community of army families from falling bostel in germany who had just arrived at lucas dave was heavily involved with five education services to design the new madras college in its site at bilbray on the western edge of saint andrews and in supporting the transition of the south st buildings to the university which will soon become the university's new college at madras dave developed a strong community and improved outcomes for all pupils attainment in qualifications improved significantly with the school highly ranked in scotland for achievements in five hires alongside academic excellence dave was committed to improving outcomes for every pupil with a curriculum where wider achievement opportunities were built-in across the school rather than as an added element one of his proudest achievements was securing a very good HMI inspection report in 2015 cited as demonstrating an ethos of learning for all and raising attainment every year he also reorganised the school day to safeguard the curriculum in the face of quite draconian financial cuts substantial and inspired solutions were required to accommodate these cuts but the breadth of curriculum and quality of teaching remain his legacy dave was keenly involved in outreach activities at buck haven and madras supporting the first chances project with the university he was also a strong supporter of the university's communication and teaching in science module which gives students training in communicating in classroom settings and experience of working with school pupils even giving lectures to students before they went out into schools but first and foremost dave was a maths teacher he never lost his enthusiasm for his subject and loved to explore its applications fascinated by the pedagogy of mathematics he had very clear ideas on the most effective ways to teach it and was even clearer when education scotland seemed to be diverging from the path of mathematical righteousness his commitment to his subject remained throughout his career teaching mathematics each week for every one of his 45 years into his 70s it would be remiss not to mention the support of day's wife liz throughout his career from enrolling three of their five children at nursery in order to teach maths alongside dave when buck haven's reputation made it hard to attract teachers to the double act at madras with dave striding around the quad dealing with non blazer wearing rebels while liz sat in the guidance base with those struggling to attend supporting them through qualifications dave maintains it was a privilege to work with the staff pupils communities and partners he met in his career managing the challenges of change while always keeping to the fore the core value of delivering a quality education in all of its aspects to all of his pupils in support of the community this commitment to every one of his students elicits comments from pupils parents and colleagues such as brilliant he put his heart and soul into that place would have been there forever if he could he loved madras everything about it and everyone like superman inspirational and extraordinary leader i could have spent my entire time here reading out similar comments from people across his professional career a clear testament to the impact davis had on so many people chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to the education of young people in saint andrews and across scotland and the key role he has played in the relationship between madras college and the university i invite you to present david mcclure with the university medal we're concerned problem i call that one professor paul hibbert the dean of arts and divinity professor hubert chancellor colleagues special guests and graduates my friends it's usual in this kind of speech for older folk like me to try and raise the aspirations of younger folk and those young at heart whose graduations we are celebrating we move swiftly from praising your terrific abilities and superlative achievements to setting out a list of modest challenges like ending hunger or achieving world peace or discovering the meaning of life no pressure well the time between your graduation and your return here today has been hard enough without all of that so instead i'm going to do you a favor by completing one of those challenges for you today i'm going to tell you the meaning of life now we might be tempted to look up into a clear moonless night under the light of 100 billion galaxies and look for meaning through the lens of science science is making good progress in establishing the simple laws that govern the universe but as impressive as it is it's not what things mean it's simply how things work or we might seek to grow rich enough to have $100 billion and shoot our ego into the sky in a suspiciously shaped rocket but that's just vanity and doesn't mean anything and if you get there you'll find it's nothing but space man the truth is you can't find the meaning of life through scientific or literal exploration even if it takes you beyond the earth this is because meaning isn't a discoverable thing instead it's something that is made for example in our unimaginably vast universe as far as we know we're the only creatures looking up into the stars and making stories about the constellations we imagine we have filled the sky with heroes and mythical beasts it's in the nature of human creativity to make meaning and that meaning does not depend on cold facts or on our physical limitations on this planet we exceed those limitations through our creation of meaningful culture in art in writing in music and in so many other fields we also create meaningful work in science education industry and public service and through that create the resources and opportunities for everyone to flourish and participate but everything doesn't have to be on a grand scale we also make meaning in moments of laughter amongst friends in clever conversation in unexpected generous kindness that thwarts greed and oh oh in the blessed mystery of love i suspect that most graduates here today will have returned in part because of memories of times like those you already know how meaningful they are therefore the answer to the question what is the meaning of life at least human life is this it's up to us it's up to you you've already shown yourselves to be awesome students and graduates in the most difficult of times you now have the chance to make the most of all of your possibilities and potential on your own terms so in closing i wish you every success in making meaning in the way that works best for you whether in art education science industry or public service as you do so i hope you continue to make friendships that bring inspiration and laughter and share with someone what it means to love and be loved you deserve nothing less and i wish you all the best of luck please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism ahmed",

Her yessum christum Dominum nostrum Amen. Please be seated. I called upon the principle of the university. Good afternoon everyone. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions, and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic, it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and love. Bombs in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929, the younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalized this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations. Being refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception. And our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a Center for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. The royal leaders of Scotland and later of the United Kingdom have been a guiding, enriching and at times challenging presence in our history. Saint Andrews was the spiritual home of Scotland and on occasion hosted the Scottish Court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the Royal household. Our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, served as an adviser and diplomat to King Robert the 3rd and later as tutor and Protector to his son the future. King James, the first of Scotland, who resided with him in Saint Andrews Castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to France, which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in England for 18 years. King James Revisited St. Andrews throughout his life, celebrating Christmas here in 1425, and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to Perth. His request was dutifully and happily ignored. Our university library, the oldest continuous library in Scotland, is indebted to royal patronage. King James, the 6th of Scotland and 1st of England visited St. Andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the University Library. A building in his honour to accommodate this collection, the King James Library was completed in 1643 on South St. This was a key moment for the early library, but one suspects that King James was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign. King James clashed repeatedly with Andrew Melville, a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as Principal of Saint Mary's College from 1580 and as rector from 1590, Melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university, but was resistant to royal interference. Given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether, King James locked Melville in the Tower of London. Royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to Lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life. Throughout its existence. We enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating Her Majesty, the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. We have been honoured by the presence of Her Majesty. Periodically throughout her reign, most recently at the graduation of our alumni, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a graduation ceremony. Rather like this one in 2005, we were delighted to welcome their Royal Highnesses back to the university for a visit in May 2021 and earlier this month, we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge at the Universities Wardlaw Museum. Our recently. Redevelop museum, situated on the schools, which is well worth a visit. In crossing today's stage, each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps, but also in the footsteps of the academics, leaders and Changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of Fife to shape the world in profound ways. The journey you make from here is yours to envisage, but their example is 1, from which we can all draw inspiration. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, it is my pleasure to welcome you all, after which the confirmation of degrees by the Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will commence. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities 2 years later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in July 2020, and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way, although the latter, in which the Chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. The Chancellor will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and he will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirm the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP to most though. The Chancellor will simply say ET superette, meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our Vators Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director Claire in his Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion the choir will today be conducted by Doctor Michael Downes, director of music. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of the University medal upon today's guest of honour. Mr. David McClure. Due to the indisposition of the academic registrar, Mary Noel, early, I will deliver the citation address on behalf of the university. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is the assistant vice principal Dean of Arts and divinity professor Paul Hibbert. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews, and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

Chancellor, it is my privilege to present David McClure for the university medal. Dave McClure started his professional career as an engineer working on nuclear sites at Junrey and Hunterston B before being drawn to a career in teaching teaching mathematics in. Year in 1975 was the start of a 45 year career teaching young people in nine schools across Scotland. Quickly moving through principal teacher positions, Dave was appointed deputy rector at Buck Haven High School in leaven in 2001, following a difficult HM IE inspection including one of the worst reports ever written. Although Dave acting as rector at the time, received one of the few positive comments he was subsequently appointed rector in 2003. On the day of the interview, staff were invited into the Assembly hall and when it was announced that he had been appointed, they let off party poppers, cheering and stamping their feet. I knew that they were part of something special. His clear vision and ability to bring stuff with him on his journey inspired everyone. One of his colleagues told us that when he stood and addressed the staff, they would have followed him into battle. The following year, a glowing HMI report identified Dave's leadership as the foundation on which improvements in attendance, behaviour and attainment were built. Articles in the Herald, the BBC and the Times praised his leadership and approach to improvement across the school. Characteristically, Dave attributes this turnaround of Buck Haven to the hard work and perseverance of the staff and pupils, rather than himself. In 2005, however, he was invited to meet the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in recognition of his impact at the school and then again in 2006 as one of just 10 head teachers across the UK. For a one to one meeting to recognise his and the schools ongoing success. In 2013, five education services asked him to take up the post of rector at Madras College. Beyond the rigours of developing and delivering the curriculum, one of his first challenges was supporting the relocation and integration within the school community of Army families from falling Bostel in Germany who had just arrived at Lucas. Dave was heavily involved with five education services to design the new Madras College in its site at Bilbray on the western edge of Saint Andrews, and in supporting the transition of the South St buildings to the university which will soon become the university's new college at Madras. Dave developed a strong community and improved outcomes for all pupils. Attainment in qualifications improved significantly with the school highly ranked in Scotland. For achievements in five hires alongside academic excellence, Dave was committed to improving outcomes for every pupil with a curriculum where wider achievement opportunities were built-in across the school rather than as an added element. One of his proudest achievements was securing a very good HMI inspection report in 2015, cited as demonstrating an ethos of learning for all and raising attainment every year he also reorganised the school day to safeguard the curriculum in the face of quite draconian financial cuts, substantial and inspired solutions were required to accommodate these cuts, but the breadth of curriculum and quality of teaching remain. His legacy. Dave was keenly involved in outreach activities at Buck Haven and Madras, supporting the first chances project with the university. He was also a strong supporter of the university's communication and teaching in science module, which gives students training in communicating in classroom settings and experience of working with school pupils, even giving lectures to students before they went out into schools. But first and foremost, Dave was a maths teacher. He never lost his enthusiasm for his subject and loved to explore its applications. Fascinated by the pedagogy of mathematics, he had very clear ideas on the most effective ways to teach it, and was even clearer when education Scotland seemed to be diverging from the path of mathematical righteousness. His commitment to his subject remained throughout his career teaching mathematics each week. For every one of his 45 years into his 70s. It would be remiss not to mention the support of day's wife, Liz, throughout his career from enrolling three of their five children at Nursery in order to teach maths alongside Dave when Buck Haven's reputation made it hard to attract teachers to the double Act at Madras, with Dave Striding around the quad dealing with non blazer wearing rebels while Liz sat in the guidance base with those struggling to attend, supporting them through qualifications. Dave maintains it was a privilege to work with the staff, pupils, communities and partners he met in his career, managing the challenges of change while always keeping to the fore. The core value of delivering a quality education in all of its aspects to all of his pupils in support of the community. This commitment to every one of his students elicits comments from pupils, parents and colleagues such as brilliant. He put his heart and soul into that place. Would have been there forever. If he could he loved Madras everything about it and everyone like Superman, inspirational and extraordinary leader, I could have spent my entire time here reading out similar comments from people across his professional career. A clear testament to the impact Davis had on so many people. Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to the education of young people in Saint Andrews and across Scotland, and the key role he has played in the relationship between Madras College and the university. I invite you to present David McClure with the University medal. We're concerned. Problem. I call that one professor Paul Hibbert. The Dean of Arts and Divinity Professor Hubert. Chancellor colleagues, special guests and graduates my friends. It's usual in this kind of speech for older folk like me to try and raise the aspirations of younger folk and those young at heart, whose graduations we are celebrating. We move swiftly from praising your terrific abilities and superlative achievements to setting out a list of modest challenges like ending hunger or achieving World Peace, or discovering the meaning of life. No pressure. Well, the time between your graduation and your return here today has been hard enough without all of that. So instead I'm going to do you a favor by completing one of those challenges for you today. I'm going to tell you the meaning of life. Now we might be tempted to look up into a clear, moonless night under the light of 100 billion galaxies and look for meaning through the lens of science. Science is making good progress in establishing the simple laws that govern the universe. But as impressive as it is, it's not what things mean. It's simply how things work. Or we might seek to grow rich enough to have $100 billion and shoot our ego into the sky in a suspiciously shaped rocket. But that's just vanity and doesn't mean anything. And if you get there, you'll find it's nothing but space man. The truth is you can't find the meaning of life through scientific or literal exploration, even if it takes you beyond the earth. This is because meaning isn't a discoverable thing. Instead, it's something that is made. For example, in our unimaginably vast universe, as far as we know, we're the only creatures looking up into the stars and making stories about the constellations we imagine. We have filled the sky with heroes and mythical beasts. It's in the nature of human creativity to make meaning, and that meaning does not depend on cold facts or on our physical limitations on this planet. We exceed those limitations through our creation of meaningful culture in art. In writing, in music, and in so many other fields. We also create meaningful work in science education, industry and public service and through that create the resources and opportunities for everyone to flourish and participate. But everything doesn't have to be on a grand scale. We also make meaning in moments of laughter amongst friends in clever conversation, in unexpected, generous kindness that thwarts greed. And oh, oh, in the blessed mystery of love. I suspect that most graduates here today will have returned in part because of memories of times like those. You already know how meaningful they are. Therefore, the answer to the question what is the meaning of life at least human life? Is this? It's up to us. It's up to you. You've already shown yourselves to be awesome students and graduates in the most difficult of times. You now have the chance to make the most of all of your possibilities and potential on your own terms. So in closing, I wish you every success in making meaning in the way that works best for you, whether in art, education, science, industry or public service, as you do so. I hope you continue to make friendships that bring inspiration and laughter, and share with someone what it means to love and be loved. You deserve nothing less, and I wish you all the best of luck. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism, Ahmed."
