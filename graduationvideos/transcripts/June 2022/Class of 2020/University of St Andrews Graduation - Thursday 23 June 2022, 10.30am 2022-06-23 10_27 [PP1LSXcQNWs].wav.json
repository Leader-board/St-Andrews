resist i call upon the principle of the university good morning everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i'm delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online in the summer due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger wall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors as is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of fifteenth century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history the scotty chronicle which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that saint louis was born in circa three hundred AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited one evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint louis brought the relics which constituted one tooth one kneecap one humorous and saint andrew 's right hand to what bauer describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation 's patron saint the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued saint andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its six hundred years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the fifteenth century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in fourteen seventy nine and fourteen ninety four respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas 's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar 's poetry was among the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in fifteen oh eight and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin ennead into scots completing this in fifteen thirteen these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of saint leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the sixth of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in fifteen sixty five later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin poetry delici portalarium scott torum was sponsored by a graduate an early philanthropist of our university john scott in sixteen thirty seven and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from seventeen sixty five to seventeen sixty eight and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by willow mure an early female graduate of our university in nineteen ten who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that lemures perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today host some of the world 's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalize upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veders chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer our vice chancellor it is my pleasure to welcome you all after which the confirmation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities two years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july twenty twenty and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which the chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since salvatores chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour dame anne pringle to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker will be professor richard watmore from the school of history the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but joining a rich association of alumni and we very much hope that you will continue as an saint andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artis altium chancellor i asked you to confirm the degree of master of arts general on annabel barry today at kroger magistra artium confirmo curious

elizabeth mundy it's super tasty fish i called upon the principle of the university chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of letters honoris causa dame ann pringle dame anne pringle 's appointment as her majesty 's ambassador to the russian federation in two thousand and eight did not pass without notice russia is a diplomatic posting of distinct challenge and one loaded with a higher than usual level of public interest and political weight and two thousand and eight was not an insignificant year vladimir putin who had served as president since two thousand transitioned to the role of prime minister and the short lived russo georgian war in august was one of the first conflicts of the twenty first century on european soil the inheritor of this political landscape would shoulder an enormous responsibility and it is in that context that day man became the first woman ambassador since queen victoria established the position in eighteen sixty something which even just a few years ago did not go unchallenged damon commented in response to detractors i'm not a pushover i'm quite resolute very focused and committed i draw from personal experience in confirming these attributes at saint andrews we know daiman as an alumna but also as the former senior governor of the university court our highest governing body jay man is also a natural leader and decision maker and astute judge of both people and situations utterly fearless and an extremely hard worker formidable though she may be those who work with daiman are also familiar with her generosity sense of humour and unceasing desire to turn her years of experience toward good causes leadership respect and friendship can often be contending forces and it takes a character of damann 's calibre to embody these qualities simultaneously it is thus a source of pride that dame anne is a child of scotland she attended glasgow high school for girls followed by the university of saint andrews where in nineteen seventy seven she attained her master of arts with honours in french and german daman graduated straight into the foreign and commonwealth office or FCO cutting her teeth at postings in moscow toward the end of leonid brezhnev 's tenure as general secretary and in brussels at the european union diamond 's first senior posting in nineteen ninety six was as head of the SCO common foreign and security policy department and two years later she was appointed head of the eastern department in which role she was responsible for developing an engagement strategy for the newly elected president putin her first ambassadorial posting was as her majesty 's ambassador to the czech republic from two thousand one to two thousand and four during which time day man assisted in preparing for chequers membership of the EU ratified at the end of her tenure and a man returned to london in two thousand and four when she was appointed director of strategy and information in which capacity she produced the SCO 's global strategy and one of the first two and was one of the first two female members of the SCO board it was at this time in two thousand and four that day man services were first recognised by her majesty the queen through her appointment his companion of the order of saint michael and saint george of which order and was subsequently appointed dame commander in two thousand and ten damon assumed the ambassadorship to russia in two thousand and eight returning in two thousand and eleven and from two thousand and twelve to two thousand and sixteen she served as a member of the UK foreign secretaries lucano group established by the secretary of state to capitalise upon the knowledge of our leading diplomats day ma'am contemporaneously served as a public appointment successor chairing panels to elect the head of major public bodies including the court of the bank of england and from two thousand and thirteen to two thousand and fifteen day man served as the UK government 's special representative on deportation with assurances de mum has herself turned towards senior governance positions in recent years from two thousand and twelve to two thousand and twenty one she served as a non executive director of the ashmore group and she served as senior governor of the university of saint andrews in two thousand and sixteen to two thousand and twenty and she has served as a trustee of shakespeare 's globe theatre in london since two thousand and sixteen the honorary doctorate the university is awarding day man reflects her monumental contributions to the international order it also captures however an equally significant contribution to our university damon joined our university court in two thousand and twelve and she was elected by her peers as senior governor in two thousand a thousand and sixteen that rule which has since been reconstituted by government as the senior lay member is one of the chief public officers of this university it's occupant steers our governing body and its subcommittees and they and the court are responsible for working with me as principal holding my office to account and realising our university strategy the scale and impact of damann 's contributions to our university are beyond measure and to see their manifestations i say look around you the younger hall redevelopment is just one of the projects that came to fruition during day man's tenure others include our ambitious sustainability and entrepreneurial projects at the eden campus in garden bridge the new laidlaw music centre and two new halls of residence powell and whitehall halls daman 's tenure oversaw the implementation of a new university strategy for two thousand and eighteen to two thousand and twenty three which has taken us to first place in the UK 's premier domestic ranking it saw us through the pandemic and its existential challenges and most importantly it has established the groundwork upon which we will build for the next generation of researchers and scholars simply put no part of our university has been untouched by day man by her dutiful service and graceful diligence and this honorary doctorate is just recognition for a friend colleague and role model who has done as much as anyone to shape the modern university of saint andrews chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to foreign diplomacy and the university of saint andrews i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters honoris causa on damann pringle today i graham told us that terrarium and norris kaiser promotio could you spray in symbolum suffragette hope berekum imponer that's you guys chancellor vice chancellor 's distinguished guests graduates it's an honour to be with you today for your graduation from one of the finest universities in the world over forty years ago i sat where you're sitting now wondering what life had in store the world looked somewhat different then there was no social media no ipads no iphones but we did have TV 's and motor cars the west was in a nuclear standoff with the soviet union after failed glimmers of a thaw the UK had just voted resoundingly to continue its membership of the european economic community the foreign office looked very different than two female diplomats were forced to resign on marriage until nineteen seventy three so there weren't very many around i spent most of my career helping to forge closer cooperation with europe and dealing with the consequences of the breakup of the soviet union in nineteen ninety one which few had foreseen like generations before us we were driven by lofty ideals to forge a peaceful europe after two world wars and to defend our freedoms against extremist ideologies we were also realistic about the challenges there was a brief window of optimism at the end of the cold war that a europe hall and free might become a reality we celebrated as central european countries the baltic states and others chose to take their place among free nations so did they and they still do we were not naive about russia but hopeful that a more prosperous russia integrated into the global trading system whose citizens enjoyed freedoms unheard of under communism might have a stake in a more settled european neighbourhood and in tackling global challenges together the russian invasion of ukraine has shattered that post cold war optimism and effort it's a rare thing to live through a moment of huge historical consequence as we do now and try to draw the right lessons this new age will impact all our lives here are three issues for you to consider firstly and however try to my sound liberal values really do matter corrupt self serving governments do not deliver good governance and rarely care extremists of any hue do not do so either secondly freedom is not free we must nurture the liberties we largely take for granted or risk seeing them snatched away that means paying for security and defence supporting the rule of law and independent media and judiciary when governments declare heinous acts to be read lines they should be just that red lines tyrants read inaction as weakness and will always press their advantage thirdly never underestimate the power of individuals to change the course of history for good it was not a given that the polish shipyard worker left valenza or the czech playwright vaslav havel would become presidents of their respective countries they expect to be shot for resisting a communist chokehold solensky is another hero of our times each of you individually can make a difference if you are prepared to speak up against what you know to be wrong i wish you were inheriting a safer world however i take comfort from the determination of many people not to be cowed from your generations ability to tackle the global problems we face not least climate change and poverty with compassion and imagination so please my message to you today is take responsibility for the world around you and be as courageous as you can be thank you i call upon professor richard watmore of the school of history chancellor honoured guests colleagues graduates on this great and glorious day for everyone here the first necessity is self congratulation you are graduating in person after some of the most challenging educational experiences in living memory your time in higher education may have been odd you may have spent a lamentable lockdown sick of the sight of your parents siblings guardians and partners but again you are nevertheless graduating with a degree from what the most objective and accurate league table ever made throughout recorded history has identified as the highest ranked university in the UK a second necessity is to bear a thought for those parents and guardians who will have suffered at least as much as you through being cooped up together contributing to your studies may have near bankrupted them it will have worried them at times pained and strained them they may have aged prematurely so now is a time for them as well to relax to shout we made it all parents guardians and partners deserve special congratulation and applause one of my sons who has yet to graduate and is not at this place says to me he feels mugged off by the educational experience he's had under covid with cynical staff depressed students and a rotten world out there afterwards he has a point the world especially for people like me was a lot easier than yours we had more funding prices were more related to incomes and the world was less obsessed about grades and performance and we were ignorant about the environmental calamity we were causing and even if we knew about it few people did anything does that mean you should emphasise how bad the present is because of the failures of my generation perhaps but i want to tell you to be more optimistic because of the experience of saint andrews it gives hope i'll need to explain what i mean saint andrews is a community of aliens brought together from all parts of the earth no nation or culture predominates the bubble is genuinely cosmopolitan there are lots of academics in each subject classes are small and as students you will have been both looked after when you needed it and directed educationally to the position of excellence you have evidenced in order to be celebrating your graduation today saint andrews is a small republic with a diverse community that has to be tolerant and kind towards its citizens respecting each other while toiling academically this is a remarkable achievement because republics i can tell you because i'm a historian of political thought are prone to civil wars and internecine domestic conflict saint andrews two was once a fanatic community whose members wanted to kill one another you will all have seen the martyrs monument to those who were burned alive and the marks on the pavement showing the spot where exactly this happened the terrible history of intolerance and civil violence derived from division about religion and the belief that murdering your enemies was what god wanted you to do in the present there are plenty of people who believe that the only successful community derives from negativity from the social glue that arises from defining your enemies and hating them blaming them for everything that's gone wrong seeking their exclusion and banishment from the community hatred is a powerful force especially for democratic politicians who want to hide their uselessness as problem solvers the best communities are the opposite of fanatic you have experienced one here in saint andrews yes of course partly it works because you can escape from your fellow students and staff during long holidays but remember the lesson avoid exclusive and fanatic communities but above all celebrate this day during your time here you've seen saint andrews rise above oxbridge go out have confidence continue to support your alma mater so that without hatred superiority or division a future objective international league table will state that not only oxbridge have fallen behind saint andrews but princeton yale and harvard too please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti side kumon nebus nobis in secular secular orum amen no no good where's that from",

this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929 the younger hall closed in july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger wall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors as is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the 12th century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in 1318 university instruction commenced here in may 1410 when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from peniscola in august 1413 which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history the scotty chronicle which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that saint louis was born in circa 300 AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited 1 evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint louis brought the relics which constituted one tooth 1 kneecap 1 humorous and saint andrew's right hand to what bauer describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation's patron st the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued st andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its 600 years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in 1479 and 1494 respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar's poetry was among the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in 1508 and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin ennead into scots completing this in 1513 these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of st leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the 6th of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in 1565 later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin poetry delici portalarium scott torum was sponsored by a graduate an early philanthropist of our university john scott in 1637 and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from 1765 to 17 68 and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by willow mure an early female graduate of our university in 1910 who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that lemures perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today host some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalize upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veders chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer our vice chancellor it is my pleasure to welcome you all after which the confirmation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence this ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities 2 years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july 2020 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which the chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since salvatores chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour dame anne pringle to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker will be professor richard watmore from the school of history the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but joining a rich association of alumni and we very much hope that you will continue as an st andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artis altium chancellor i asked you to confirm the degree of master of arts general on annabel barry today at kroger magistra artium

appointment as her majesty's ambassador to the russian federation in 2008 did not pass without notice russia is a diplomatic posting of distinct challenge and one loaded with a higher than usual level of public interest and political weight and 2008 was not an insignificant year vladimir putin who had served as president since 2000 transitioned to the role of prime minister and the short lived russo georgian war in august was one of the first conflicts of the 21st century on european soil the inheritor of this political landscape would shoulder an enormous responsibility and it is in that context that day man became the first woman ambassador since queen victoria established the position in 1860 something which even just a few years ago did not go unchallenged damon commented in response to detractors i'm not a pushover i'm quite resolute very focused and committed i draw from personal experience in confirming these attributes at saint andrews we know daiman as an alumna but also as the former senior governor of the university court our highest governing body jay man is also a natural leader and decision maker and astute judge of both people and situations utterly fearless and an extremely hard worker formidable though she may be those who work with daiman are also familiar with her generosity sense of humour and unceasing desire to turn her years of experience toward good causes leadership respect and friendship can often be contending forces and it takes a character of damann's calibre to embody these qualities simultaneously it is thus a source of pride that dame anne is a child of scotland she attended glasgow high school for girls followed by the university of saint andrews where in 1977 she attained her master of arts with honours in french and german daman graduated straight into the foreign and commonwealth office or FCO cutting her teeth at postings in moscow toward the end of leonid brezhnev's tenure as general secretary and in brussels at the european union diamond's first senior posting in 1996 was as head of the SCO common foreign and security policy department and two years later she was appointed head of the eastern department in which role she was responsible for developing an engagement strategy for the newly elected president putin her first ambassadorial posting was as her majesty's ambassador to the czech republic from 2001 to 2004 during which time day man assisted in preparing for chequers membership of the EU ratified at the end of her tenure and a man returned to london in 2004 when she was appointed director of strategy and information in which capacity she produced the SCO's global strategy and one of the first two and was one of the first two female members of the SCO board it was at this time in 2004 that day man services were first recognised by her majesty the queen through her appointment his companion of the order of saint michael and saint george of which order and was subsequently appointed dame commander in 2010 damon assumed the ambassadorship to russia in 2008 returning in 2011 and from 2012 to 2016 she served as a member of the UK foreign secretaries lucano group established by the secretary of state to capitalise upon the knowledge of our leading diplomats day ma'am contemporaneously served as a public appointment successor chairing panels to elect the head of major public bodies including the court of the bank of england and from 2013 to 2015 day man served as the UK government's special representative on deportation with assurances de mum has herself turned towards senior governance positions in recent years from 2012 to 2021 she served as a non executive director of the ashmore group and she served as senior governor of the university of saint andrews in 2016 to 2020 and she has served as a trustee of shakespeare's globe theatre in london since 2016 the honorary doctorate the university is awarding day man reflects her monumental contributions to the international order it also captures however an equally significant contribution to our university damon joined our university court in 2012 and she was elected by her peers as senior governor in 2000 a 1016 that rule which has since been reconstituted by government as the senior lay member is one of the chief public officers of this university it's occupant steers our governing body and its subcommittees and they and the court are responsible for working with me as principal holding my office to account and realising our university strategy the scale and impact of damann's contributions to our university are beyond measure and to see their manifestations i say look around you the younger hall redevelopment is just one of the projects that came to fruition during day man's tenure others include our ambitious sustainability and entrepreneurial projects at the eden campus in garden bridge the new laidlaw music centre and two new halls of residence powell and whitehall halls daman's tenure oversaw the implementation of a new university strategy for 2018 to 2023 which has taken us to 1st place in the UK's premier domestic ranking it saw us through the pandemic and its existential challenges and most importantly it has established the groundwork upon which we will build for the next generation of researchers and scholars simply put no part of our university has been untouched by day man by her dutiful service and graceful diligence and this honorary doctorate is just recognition for a friend colleague and role model who has done as much as anyone to shape the modern university of saint andrews chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to foreign diplomacy and the university of saint andrews i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters honoris causa on damann pringle today i graham told us that terrarium and norris kaiser promotio could you spray in symbolum suffragette hope berekum imponer that's you guys chancellor vice chancellor's distinguished guests graduates it's an honour to be with you today for your graduation from one of the finest universities in the world over 40 years ago i sat where you're sitting now wondering what life had in store the world looked somewhat different then there was no social media no iPads no iphones but we did have TV's and motor cars the west was in a nuclear standoff with the soviet union after failed glimmers of a thaw the UK had just voted resoundingly to continue its membership of the european economic community the foreign office looked very different than two female diplomats were forced to resign on marriage until 1973 so there weren't very many around i spent most of my career helping to forge closer cooperation with europe and dealing with the consequences of the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 which few had foreseen like generations before us we were driven by lofty ideals to forge a peaceful europe after two world wars and to defend our freedoms against extremist ideologies we were also realistic about the challenges there was a brief window of optimism at the end of the cold war that a europe hall and free might become a reality we celebrated as central european countries the baltic states and others chose to take their place among free nations so did they and they still do we were not naive about russia but hopeful that a more prosperous russia integrated into the global trading system whose citizens enjoyed freedoms unheard of under communism might have a stake in a more settled european neighbourhood and in tackling global challenges together the russian invasion of ukraine has shattered that post cold war optimism and effort it's a rare thing to live through a moment of huge historical consequence as we do now and try to draw the right lessons this new age will impact all our lives here are three issues for you to consider firstly and however try to my sound liberal values really do matter corrupt self serving governments do not deliver good governance and rarely care extremists of any hue do not do so either secondly freedom is not free we must nurture the liberties we largely take for granted or risk seeing them snatched away that means paying for security and defence supporting the rule of law and independent media and judiciary when governments declare heinous acts to be read lines they should be just that red lines tyrants read inaction as weakness and will always press their advantage thirdly never underestimate the power of individuals to change the course of history for good it was not a given that the polish shipyard worker left valenza or the czech playwright vaslav havel would become presidents of their respective countries they expect to be shot for resisting a communist chokehold solensky is another hero of our times each of you individually can make a difference if you are prepared to speak up against what you know to be wrong i wish you were inheriting a safer world however i take comfort from the determination of many people not to be cowed from your generations ability to tackle the global problems we face not least climate change and poverty with compassion and imagination so please my message to you today is take responsibility for the world around you and be as courageous as you can be thank you i call upon professor richard watmore of the school of history chancellor honoured guests colleagues graduates on this great and glorious day for everyone here the first necessity is self congratulation you are graduating in person after some of the most challenging educational experiences in living memory your time in higher education may have been odd you may have spent a lamentable lockdown sick of the sight of your parents siblings guardians and partners but again you are nevertheless graduating with a degree from what the most objective and accurate league table ever made throughout recorded history has identified as the highest ranked university in the UK a second necessity is to bear a thought for those parents and guardians who will have suffered at least as much as you through being cooped up together contributing to your studies may have near bankrupted them it will have worried them at times pained and strained them they may have aged prematurely so now is a time for them as well to relax to shout we made it all parents guardians and partners deserve special congratulation and applause one of my sons who has yet to graduate and is not at this place says to me he feels mugged off by the educational experience he's had under covid with cynical staff depressed students and a rotten world out there afterwards he has a point the world especially for people like me was a lot easier than yours we had more funding prices were more related to incomes and the world was less obsessed about grades and performance and we were ignorant about the environmental calamity we were causing and even if we knew about it few people did anything does that mean you should emphasise how bad the present is because of the failures of my generation perhaps but i want to tell you to be more optimistic because of the experience of saint andrews it gives hope i'll need to explain what i mean saint andrews is a community of aliens brought together from all parts of the earth no nation or culture predominates the bubble is genuinely cosmopolitan there are lots of academics in each subject classes are small and as students you will have been both looked after when you needed it and directed educationally to the position of excellence you have evidenced in order to be celebrating your graduation today saint andrews is a small republic with a diverse community that has to be tolerant and kind towards its citizens respecting each other while toiling academically this is a remarkable achievement because republics i can tell you because i'm a historian of political thought are prone to civil wars and internecine domestic conflict saint andrews two was once a fanatic community whose members wanted to kill one another you will all have seen the martyrs monument to those who were burned alive and the marks on the pavement showing the spot where exactly this happened the terrible history of intolerance and civil violence derived from division about religion and the belief that murdering your enemies was what god wanted you to do in the present there are plenty of people who believe that the only successful community derives from negativity from the social glue that arises from defining your enemies and hating them blaming them for everything that's gone wrong seeking their exclusion and banishment from the community hatred is a powerful force especially for democratic politicians who want to hide their uselessness as problem solvers the best communities are the opposite of fanatic you have experienced 1 here in saint andrews yes of course partly it works because you can escape from your fellow students and staff during long holidays but remember the lesson avoid exclusive and fanatic communities but above all celebrate this day during your time here you've seen saint andrews rise above oxbridge go out have confidence continue to support your alma mater so that without hatred superiority or division a future objective international league table will state that not only oxbridge have fallen behind saint andrews but princeton yale and harvard too please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti side kumon nebus nobis in secular secular orum amen no no good where's that from",

I call upon the principle of the university. Good morning everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I'm delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online in the summer. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger wall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded. And some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge. And their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. As is not, however, a story of survival but of Leadership, Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural and intellectual development since our inception. And our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland senior Bishop, and consecrated. Upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town. And university status was formalised when Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. Walter Bauer, a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century Scotland, described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of Scottish history, the Scotty Chronicle, which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination. Legend has it that Saint Louis was born in circa 300 AD and was a Bishop in Patras, Greece, when he was visited 1 evening. By an Angel who instructed him to take the bones of Saint Andrew far from the reach of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. Saint Louis brought the relics, which constituted one tooth, 1 kneecap, 1 humorous and Saint Andrew's right hand to what Bauer describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun, and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in Saint Andrews, which have proven so formative for contemporary Scotland, developed with Saint Andrew, later becoming the nation's patron St. The lyrical origins of our town and university imbued St. Andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a Crucible for literary creativity. Throughout its 600 years. Walter Bowers Mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas, who graduated in 1479 and 1494, respectively, and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early Modern Scotland. Dunbar, and Douglas's use of Scots was foundational for much literature that followed. Dunbar's poetry was among the first items printed in Scotland by the Edinburgh Printers, Chapman and Miller in 1508, and Douglas was the first translator of VERGIL'S Latin Ennead into Scots. Completing this in 1513. These were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university, including one who would become Principal of St. Leonards College, George Buchanan. The most significant Latin poet of his time. Buchanan was amongst many occupations, a tutor to Mary, Queen of Scots and later King James, the 6th of Scotland, and he served as a poet at Mary's Court, in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks, including a special Commission for the wedding of Mary to Lord Darnley. In 1565 later generations were equally influential. The first major printed anthology of Scottish Latin poetry, delici Portalarium Scott Torum, was sponsored by a graduate, an early philanthropist of our university, John Scott, in 1637. And while we cannot claim to have educated Robert Burns who lived degree less to his end days, Saint Andrews was the academic home of the Scottish poet Robert Ferguson, who studied here from 1765 to 17. 68 and whom Burns held in higher esteem than all other writers. Literary life thrived in more recent centuries, and literary translation in particular was taken up by Willow Mure, an early female graduate of our university in 1910, who with her husband Edwin, translated works by such luminaries as Herman Brooke and Franz Kafka. The literary culture that lemures perpetuated, complemented the research activities of our School of English, which today host some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners. We are highly distinctive in accommodating poets, dramatists and creatives, including Professor Don Patterson OBE Professor John Burnside, and Professor Zinnie Harris, whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour. Capitalize upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veders Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor. Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. Our vice chancellor. It is my pleasure to welcome you all, after which the confirmation of degrees by the Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will commence. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities 2 years later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in July 2020, and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred, with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies. In every way, although the Latin which the Chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. The Chancellor will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties. And he will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as. I confirmed the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap. To most though, the Chancellor will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since Salvatores Chapel Choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins, for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Dame Anne Pringle. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker will be Professor Richard Watmore from the School of History. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. And you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community but joining a rich association of alumni and we very much hope that you will continue as an St Andrean throughout your life. Decanus faculty Artis Altium.

Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa Dame Ann Pringle. Dame Anne Pringle's appointment as Her Majesty's Ambassador to the Russian Federation in 2008 did not pass without notice. Russia is a diplomatic posting of distinct challenge and one loaded with a higher than usual level of public interest and political weight. And 2008 was not an insignificant year. Vladimir Putin, who had served as president since 2000, transitioned to the role of Prime Minister and the short lived Russo Georgian War in August was one of the first conflicts of the 21st century on European soil. The inheritor of this political landscape would shoulder an enormous responsibility and it is in that context that day man became the first woman ambassador since Queen Victoria established the position in 1860, something which even just a few years ago did not go unchallenged. Damon commented in response to detractors. I'm not a pushover. I'm quite resolute, very focused, and committed. I draw from personal experience in confirming these attributes at Saint Andrews, we know daiman as an alumna, but also as the former senior governor of the university court, our highest governing body. Jay Man is also a natural leader and decision maker and astute judge of both people and situations. Utterly fearless and an extremely hard worker. Formidable, though she may be those who work with Daiman, are also familiar with her generosity, sense of humour and unceasing desire to turn her years of experience toward good causes. Leadership, respect, and friendship can often be contending forces, and it takes a character of Damann's calibre to embody these qualities simultaneously. It is thus a source of pride that Dame Anne is a child of Scotland. She attended Glasgow High School for Girls, followed by the University of Saint Andrews, where in 1977 she attained her Master of Arts with honours in French and German. Daman graduated straight into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, or FCO cutting her teeth at postings in Moscow toward the end of Leonid Brezhnev's tenure as general secretary and in Brussels at the European Union. Diamond's first senior posting in 1996 was as head of the SCO Common Foreign and Security Policy Department, and two years later, she was appointed head of the Eastern Department, in which role she was responsible for developing an engagement strategy for the newly elected President Putin. Her first ambassadorial posting was as Her Majesty's Ambassador to the Czech Republic from 2001 to 2004, during which Time Day man assisted in preparing for Chequers membership of the EU, ratified at the end of her tenure. And a man returned to London in 2004 when she was appointed director of Strategy and Information, in which capacity she produced the SCO's Global Strategy and one of the first two, and was one of the first two female members of the SCO board. It was at this time in 2004 that day man services were first recognised by Her Majesty the Queen. Through her appointment, his Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, of which order and was subsequently appointed Dame Commander in 2010. Damon assumed the ambassadorship to Russia in 2008, returning in 2011 and from 2012 to 2016 she served as a member of the UK Foreign Secretaries Lucano Group, established by the Secretary of State to capitalise upon the knowledge of our leading diplomats. Day ma'am contemporaneously served as a public appointment successor. Chairing panels to elect the head of major public bodies, including the Court of the Bank of England and from 2013 to 2015 Day Man served as the UK government's Special representative on deportation with assurances. De Mum has herself turned towards senior governance positions in recent years. From 2012 to 2021, she served as a non executive director of the Ashmore Group and she served as senior governor of the University of Saint Andrews in 2016 to 2020 and she has served as a trustee of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London since 2016. The honorary doctorate. The university is awarding day man reflects her monumental contributions to the international order. It also captures however, an equally significant contribution to our university. Damon joined our university court in 2012 and she was elected by her peers as senior governor in 2000, a 1016 that rule, which has since been reconstituted by government as the senior Lay member, is one of the chief public officers of this university. It's occupant steers our governing body and its subcommittees, and they and the court are responsible for working with me as principal holding my office. To account and realising our university strategy. The scale and impact of damann's contributions to our university are beyond measure and to see their manifestations, I say look around you. The younger hall redevelopment is just one of the projects that came to fruition during Day Man's tenure. Others include our ambitious sustainability and entrepreneurial projects at the Eden campus in Garden Bridge, the new Laidlaw Music Centre, and two new halls of Residence Powell and Whitehall Halls. Daman's tenure oversaw the implementation of a new university strategy for 2018 to 2023, which has taken us to 1st place. In the UK's premier domestic ranking it saw us through the pandemic and its existential challenges. And most importantly, it has established the groundwork upon which we will build for the next generation of researchers and scholars. Simply put, no part of our university has been untouched by day. Man by her dutiful service and graceful diligence and this honorary doctorate is just recognition for a friend, colleague and role model who has done as much as anyone to shape the modern University of Saint Andrews. Chancellor, in recognition of her major contribution to foreign diplomacy and the University of Saint Andrews, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters. Honoris causa on Damann Pringle. Today I Graham told us that terrarium and Norris Kaiser Promotio, could you spray in symbolum? Suffragette hope berekum imponer That's you guys. Chancellor Vice Chancellor's distinguished guests graduates. It's an honour to be with you today for your graduation from one of the finest universities in the world. Over 40 years ago I sat where you're sitting now wondering what life had in store. The world looked somewhat different. Then there was no social media, no iPads, no iPhones. But we did have TV's and motor cars. The West was in a nuclear standoff with the Soviet Union after failed glimmers of a thaw. The UK had just voted resoundingly to continue its membership of the European Economic Community. The Foreign Office looked very different than two. Female diplomats were forced to resign on marriage until 1973, so there weren't very many around. I spent most of my career helping to forge closer cooperation with Europe and dealing with the consequences of the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, which few had foreseen. Like generations before us, we were driven by lofty ideals. To forge a peaceful Europe after two world wars and to defend our freedoms against extremist ideologies, we were also realistic about the challenges. There was a brief window of optimism at the end of the Cold War that a Europe Hall and free might become a reality. We celebrated as central European countries, the Baltic States and others chose to take their place among free nations. So did they and they still do. We were not naive about Russia, but hopeful that a more prosperous Russia integrated into the global trading system whose citizens enjoyed freedoms unheard of under communism. Might have a stake in a more settled European neighbourhood and in tackling global challenges together. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has shattered that post Cold War, optimism and effort. It's a rare thing to live through a moment of huge historical consequence as we do now and try to draw the right lessons. This new age will impact all our lives. Here are three issues for you to consider. Firstly, and however, try to my sound liberal values really do matter. Corrupt self serving governments do not deliver good governance and rarely care. Extremists of any hue do not do so either. Secondly, freedom is not free. We must nurture the liberties we largely take for granted or risk seeing them snatched away. That means paying for security and defence, supporting the rule of law and independent media and judiciary. When governments declare heinous acts to be read lines, they should be just that. Red lines. Tyrants read inaction as weakness and will always press their advantage. Thirdly, never underestimate the power of individuals to change the course of history for good. It was not a given that the Polish shipyard worker left valenza or the Czech playwright Vaslav Havel would become presidents of their respective countries. They expect to be shot for resisting a communist chokehold. Solensky is another hero of our times. Each of you individually can make a difference if you are prepared to speak up against what you know to be wrong. I wish you were inheriting a safer world. However, I take comfort from the determination of many people not to be cowed. From your generations ability to tackle the global problems we face, not least climate change and poverty with compassion and imagination. So please my message to you today is take responsibility for the world around you and be as courageous as you can be. Thank you. I call upon Professor Richard Watmore of the School of History. Chancellor honoured guests colleagues graduates. On this great and glorious day for everyone here, the first necessity is self congratulation. You are graduating. In person. After some of the most challenging educational experiences in living memory. Your time in higher education may have been odd. You may have spent a lamentable lockdown sick of the sight of your parents, siblings, guardians, and partners. But again. You are nevertheless graduating with a degree. From what the most objective and accurate league table ever made? Throughout recorded history. Has identified as the highest ranked university in the UK. A second necessity is to bear a thought. For those parents and guardians who will have suffered at least as much as you. Through being cooped up together. Contributing to your studies may have near bankrupted them. It will have worried them at times, pained and strained them. They may have aged prematurely. So now is a time for them as well to relax to shout we made it all parents guardians. And partners deserve special congratulation and applause. One of my sons, who has yet to graduate and is not at this place, says to me he feels mugged off. By the educational experience he's had under COVID. With cynical staff, depressed students and a rotten world out there afterwards. He has a point. The world, especially for people like me, was a lot easier than yours. We had more funding. Prices were more related to incomes and the world was less obsessed about grades and performance and we were ignorant about the environmental calamity we were causing. And even if we knew about it, few people did anything. Does that mean? You should emphasise how bad the present is because of the failures of my generation. Perhaps? But I want to tell you to be more optimistic because of the experience of Saint Andrews. It gives hope. I'll need to explain what I mean. Saint Andrews is a community of aliens. Brought together from all parts of the Earth. No nation or culture predominates. The bubble is genuinely cosmopolitan. There are lots of academics in each subject. Classes are small and as students you will have been both looked after when you needed it and directed educationally to the position of excellence you have evidenced in order to be celebrating your graduation today. Saint Andrews is a small Republic with a diverse community that has to be tolerant and kind towards its citizens, respecting each other while toiling academically. This is a remarkable achievement. Because republics I can tell you because I'm a historian of political thought, are prone to civil wars and internecine domestic conflict. Saint Andrews two was once a fanatic community whose members wanted to kill one another. You will all have seen the martyrs monument to those who were burned alive, and the marks on the pavement showing the spot where exactly this happened. The terrible history of intolerance and civil violence derived from division about religion and the belief that murdering your enemies was what God wanted you to do. In the present. There are plenty of people who believe that the only successful community derives from negativity. From the social glue that arises from defining your enemies and hating them, blaming them for everything that's gone wrong, seeking their exclusion and banishment from the community. Hatred is a powerful force, especially for Democratic politicians who want to hide their uselessness as problem solvers. The best communities are the opposite of fanatic. You have experienced 1 here in Saint Andrews. Yes, of course. Partly it works because you can escape from your fellow students and staff during long holidays. But remember the lesson. Avoid exclusive and fanatic communities. But above all, celebrate this day. During your time here, you've seen Saint Andrews rise above Oxbridge. Go out have confidence. Continue to support your alma mater so that without hatred, superiority or division a future Objective International League table will state that not only Oxbridge have fallen behind Saint Andrews, but Princeton, Yale and Harvard too. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti side Kumon Nebus nobis in secular secular orum Amen. No no good. Where's that from?"
