dominum nostrum amen please be seated good afternoon everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i'm delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremony since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teacher 's private residence as part of the curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at fifteenth century saint andrews as to distracting but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows student life in saint leonards college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started class at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continued to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like for all should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over fifty years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox i need modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds saint andrews had become as described by one contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundreds student life remember resembled many of our current graduands experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred gathered guests garden parties were spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of a hundred and forty five universities in learned societies visited and a hundred honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the belle pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes it is therefore sight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving the hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities two years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating crafts were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july twenty twenty and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our daughters choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor marcus feldman to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is the assistant vice principal dean of science professor inoca de myrtle the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrian throughout your life decanus faculty artist art seum vice chancellor i ask you to confirm the degree

population and resource studies and co director of the centre for computational evolutionary and human genomics now a naturalized american feldman was born in perth australia in nineteen forty two and after completing a degree in a masters in mathematics and statistics moved to stanford university in california in the nineteen sixties to carry out his PHD where he has been ever since rising to full professor in nineteen seventy seven feldman is now recognised as one of the world 's leading theoretical biologists renowned for his contributions to mathematical evolutionary theory feldman is the author of fifteen books and some seven hundred scientific papers on evolution ecology mathematical biology and demography including over seventy articles in nature science and in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences USA he is one over thirty major honours including being an elected member of the US national academy of sciences the comira muto award in human evolution and the society for the study of evolutions lifetime achievement award he has made profound contributions to many areas of biology including human genetics the evolution of sex recombination and epistasis nice construction theory and cultural evolution his work has been cited over seventy five thousand times which makes feldman one of the most influential biologists on the planet he has founded and been managing editor of leading biological journals and played a key role in the establishment of the santa fe institute the world 's leading research centre for complexity science feldman is not only a visionary scientist but a dedicated teacher who is also one of words for his awards for his service and mentorship one of his most pleasing legacies is that his PHD students and postdoctoral researchers populate the biology faculties of universities around the world feldman is also a scientist with a well developed social conscience he has taken a courageous stance in debunking bogus claims linking race with intelligence and with other abilities and conditions conducting the important genetic analysis that invalidate a biological concept of race applied to humans and speaking out against scientific racism however it is his contributions to the field of cultural evolution that has been particularly important to researchers at the university of saint andrews from the early nineteen seventies feldman together with fellow stanford geneticist luca cavalli schwartzer began modelling cultural inheritance cultural change over time and the coevolutionary interactions between genes and culture they're classic monograph cultural transmission and evolution published in nineteen eighty one has been cited well over five thousand times alone it's difficult to overstate the importance of these works in which much of the formal machinery for the mathematical modelling of culture and gene culture coevolution is introduced this body of theory has been used in a variety of ways including partitioning the variants in behavioural and personality traits addressing questions about the adaptive advantages of complex forms of phenotypic plasticity and investigating the evolution of particular traits ranging from language learning to conformity almost fifty years later cultural evolution has blossomed into a major interdisciplinary field with its own own society formed in two thousand and seventeen and an annual conference as one of the world 's leading centres of excellence for research into cultural evolution the members of the centre for social learning and cognitive evolution at saint andrews which includes twenty three staff collaborating across the schools of psychology and neuroscience and biology particularly appreciate feldman 's foundational contribution many researchers at saint andrews regularly used concepts methods and modelling techniques devised by feldman in their work the university of saint andrews international prominence in this field owes a debt to feldman 's colossal contribution and it is fitting that this should be marked with an honorary degree vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to biology and in particular to the development of the field of cultural evolution i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science on norris kausa on professor marcus feldman tay aradam doctoris the NCI honoris causa from movie curious ray in symbolum superette hope berekum compono congratulations it's a truly great honor to receive this degree from this wonderful university where the work on cultural evolution has reached new highs to become one of the two or three leading institutions in the world in this field and i've thoroughly enjoyed watching the growth of this discipline at saint andrews and the eminence of the university as a whole really means a great deal to me in receiving this degree and i thank you all for coming and thank kevin and vice principal vice chancellor sorry and thank you all i call upon the assistant vice principal dean of science professor inika demersal vice chancellor 's honoured guests colleagues graduates first and foremost of course my warmest congratulations to all of you celebrating the award of your degree today this day has certainly been a long time coming but our joy and pride at being here with you today are no less congratulations are also still due to all the people who have supported you along the way in getting here family friends but also your lecturers and all the other staff in saint andrews who work tirelessly and often unnoticed to support you during your degree despite the familiar gordianus the gowns the walk across the stage and the famous in andrews cap there is no way of ignoring that this is not a traditional synandra 's graduation graduation ceremonies usually marked both the end of an era and the start of something new a mixture of joy and some trepidation about what comes next although that might not be quite true today there's no loss of pride in your achievements and we're glad to be celebrating with you but as well as celebrating it is perhaps also an occasion to reflect and the last two years have certainly given us a lot to reflect on in march twenty twenty you were just weeks away from your final exams you might already have planned parties got tickets for the graduation ball your family and friends might have already organized their trip to join you here in saint andrews for your graduation ceremony but then almost overnight everything changed we all went home and in those first few weeks saint andrews became eerily quiet market street was deserted the beaches empty apart from the occasional lone dog walker and the seagulls deprived of their usual diet of discarded chips we all adjust it boots slowly and extraordinarily fast alongside caring for vulnerable family and friends and home schooling children staff and students alike got the grip with teams lectures moved online exams moved online meeting family and friends moved online the IT systems creaked but somehow held out it was an extraordinary end to your degrees and for most of you your time in saint andrews although often overused extraordinary morden applies to your journey to be here in younger hall today the intervening two years since you've graduated have been anything but normal or easy but in the midst of all the difficulties the pandemic has brought are there not also some positives to hold on to i suspect many of you will have her discovered resilience an ability to adjust and an inner strength you maybe did not know you had the final part of the degree of your degree was certainly not what you expected and you had to wait two years to get your moment crossing this stage many more of your plants will likely have changed possibly several times but if you can get a degree during a global pandemic what else could you achieve if we can individually and collectively respond to such large scale and sudden disruption can we not also rise to other challenges which are looming large the challenges facing your generation are substantial and it is easy to feel overwhelmed or powerless and yet did you not just walk across the stage here did we not respond to the pandemic collectively and look after each other shopping for elderly neighbours making masks simply reaching out to those who were struggling worldwide the number of community initiatives and individual gestures has been astonishing i suspect many of you will agree that in some form or another you had to draw on your resilience to get to this day but for me there was something else to be learned from the pandemic humility following from the realization that everything we might take for granted can suddenly come to a halt that something so small as a virus can cause disruption on a global scale so many things we would never give a second thought all at once had to be considered carefully should we see friends hug loved ones could we plan travel we will be feeling the consequences of this pandemic for a long time to come but i for one think that a little bit of humility remembering not to take things for granted is perhaps not a bad thing as well as the knowledge and skills for which you were awarded your degree basilians the ability to adjust and a bit of humility or qualities which we will be relying on during many occasions in the years to come when things are going well for you which i sincerely hope they will for every single one of you remember to occasionally pause and be grateful and if at some point in life in future life is challenging you and you find yourself wondering how you gonna get through remember your extraordinary journey to be here today although i firmly believe what i have just said i also believe there's no need to test your resilience any further just now so let me wrap up today might not be a traditional graduation ceremony but all of you austin andrews graduates so let me thank you on behalf of all of us for coming back to saint andrews and letting us share in the celebration of your achievements the last two years have been tough but seeing all of you here today gives me confidence such an extraordinary group of graduates can get through anything no matter how big the challenge thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism amen",

verbal interrogation by ones professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century st andrews as to distracting but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470 when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows student life in st leonards college over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at 5:00 AM attended mass at six started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continued to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like for all should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over 50 years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in 1742 james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in 1775 and in 1792 edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox i need modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s saint andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of 1858 introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in 1892 and by the 1900s student life remember resembled many of our current graduands experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september 1911 which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties were spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of 145 universities in learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the belle pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june 1929 its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes it is therefore sight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving the hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities 2 years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating crafts were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july 2020 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our daughters choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor marcus feldman to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is the assistant vice principal dean of science professor inoca de myrtle the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to

director of the morrison institute for population and resource studies and co director of the centre for computational evolutionary and human genomics now a naturalized american feldman was born in perth australia in 1942 and after completing a degree in a masters in mathematics and statistics moved to stanford university in california in the 1960s to carry out his PHD where he has been ever since rising to full professor in 1977 feldman is now recognised as one of the world's leading theoretical biologists renowned for his contributions to mathematical evolutionary theory feldman is the author of 15 books and some 700 scientific papers on evolution ecology mathematical biology and demography including over 70 articles in nature science and in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences USA he is 1 / 30 major honours including being an elected member of the US national academy of sciences the comira muto award in human evolution and the society for the study of evolutions lifetime achievement award he has made profound contributions to many areas of biology including human genetics the evolution of sex recombination and epistasis nice construction theory and cultural evolution his work has been cited over 75,000 times which makes feldman one of the most influential biologists on the planet he has founded and been managing editor of leading biological journals and played a key role in the establishment of the santa fe institute the world's leading research centre for complexity science feldman is not only a visionary scientist but a dedicated teacher who is also one of words for his awards for his service and mentorship one of his most pleasing legacies is that his PHD students and postdoctoral researchers populate the biology faculties of universities around the world feldman is also a scientist with a well developed social conscience he has taken a courageous stance in debunking bogus claims linking race with intelligence and with other abilities and conditions conducting the important genetic analysis that invalidate a biological concept of race applied to humans and speaking out against scientific racism however it is his contributions to the field of cultural evolution that has been particularly important to researchers at the university of saint andrews from the early 1970s feldman together with fellow stanford geneticist luca cavalli schwartzer began modelling cultural inheritance cultural change over time and the coevolutionary interactions between genes and culture they're classic monograph cultural transmission and evolution published in 1981 has been cited well over 5000 times alone it's difficult to overstate the importance of these works in which much of the formal machinery for the mathematical modelling of culture and gene culture coevolution is introduced this body of theory has been used in a variety of ways including partitioning the variants in behavioural and personality traits addressing questions about the adaptive advantages of complex forms of phenotypic plasticity and investigating the evolution of particular traits ranging from language learning to conformity almost 50 years later cultural evolution has blossomed into a major interdisciplinary field with its own own society formed in 2017 and an annual conference as one of the world's leading centres of excellence for research into cultural evolution the members of the centre for social learning and cognitive evolution at saint andrews which includes 23 staff collaborating across the schools of psychology and neuroscience and biology particularly appreciate feldman's foundational contribution many researchers at saint andrews regularly used concepts methods and modelling techniques devised by feldman in their work the university of saint andrews international prominence in this field owes a debt to feldman's colossal contribution and it is fitting that this should be marked with an honorary degree vice chancellor

kevin and vice principal vice chancellor sorry and thank you all i call upon the assistant vice principal dean of science professor inika demersal vice chancellor's honoured guests colleagues graduates first and foremost of course my warmest congratulations to all of you celebrating the award of your degree today this day has certainly been a long time coming but our joy and pride at being here with you today are no less congratulations are also still due to all the people who have supported you along the way in getting here family friends but also your lecturers and all the other staff in saint andrews who work tirelessly and often unnoticed to support you during your degree despite the familiar gordianus the gowns the walk across the stage and the famous in andrews cap there is no way of ignoring that this is not a traditional synandra's graduation graduation ceremonies usually marked both the end of an era and the start of something new a mixture of joy and some trepidation about what comes next although that might not be quite true today there's no loss of pride in your achievements and we're glad to be celebrating with you but as well as celebrating it is perhaps also an occasion to reflect and the last two years have certainly given us a lot to reflect on in march 2020 you were just weeks away from your final exams you might already have planned parties got tickets for the graduation ball your family and friends might have already organized their trip to join you here in saint andrews for your graduation ceremony but then almost overnight everything changed we all went home and in those first few weeks saint andrews became eerily quiet market street was deserted the beaches empty apart from the occasional lone dog walker and the seagulls deprived of their usual diet of discarded chips we all adjust it boots slowly and extraordinarily fast alongside caring for vulnerable family and friends and home schooling children staff and students alike got the grip with teams lectures moved online exams moved online meeting family and friends moved online the IT systems creaked but somehow held out it was an extraordinary end to your degrees and for most of you your time in saint andrews although often overused extraordinary morden applies to your journey to be here in younger hall today the intervening 2 years since you've graduated have been anything but normal or easy but in the midst of all the difficulties the pandemic has brought are there not also some positives to hold on to i suspect many of you will have her discovered resilience an ability to adjust and an inner strength you maybe did not know you had the final part of the degree of your degree was certainly not what you expected and you had to wait two years to get your moment crossing this stage many more of your plants will likely have changed possibly several times but if you can get a degree during a global pandemic what else could you achieve if we can individually and collectively respond to such large scale and sudden disruption can we not also rise to other challenges which are looming large the challenges facing your generation are substantial and it is easy to feel overwhelmed or powerless and yet did you not just walk across the stage here did we not respond to the pandemic collectively and look after each other shopping for elderly neighbours making masks simply reaching out to those who were struggling worldwide the number of community initiatives and individual gestures has been astonishing i suspect many of you will agree that in some form or another you had to draw on your resilience to get to this day but for me there was something else to be learned from the pandemic humility following from the realization that everything we might take for granted can suddenly come to a halt that something so small as a virus can cause disruption on a global scale so many things we would never give a second thought all at once had to be considered carefully should we see friends hug loved ones could we plan travel we will be feeling the consequences of this pandemic for a long time to come but i for one think that a little bit of humility remembering not to take things for granted is perhaps not a bad thing as well as the knowledge and skills for which you were awarded your degree basilians the ability to adjust and a bit of humility or qualities which we will be relying on during many occasions in the years to come when things are going well for you which i sincerely hope they will for every single one of you remember to occasionally pause and be grateful and if at some point in life in future life is challenging you and you find yourself wondering how you gonna get through remember your extraordinary journey to be here today although i firmly believe what i have just said i also believe there's no need to test your resilience any further just now so let me wrap up today might not be a traditional graduation ceremony but all of you austin andrews graduates so let me thank you on behalf of all of us for coming back to saint andrews and letting us share in the celebration of your achievements the last two years have been tough but seeing all of you here today gives me confidence such an extraordinary group of graduates can get through anything no matter how big the challenge thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism amen",

Good afternoon everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I'm delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremony. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural and intellectual development since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient. To history, but creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors, often in the teacher's private residence as part of the curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics, all inspired by Aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in Latin, which remained our official institutional language until 1747. Examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones professors, and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century St. Andrews as to distracting, but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm, was promoted. This may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470, when, after an unresolved argument, the Dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows. Student life in St. Leonards College. Over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university. Founded within a religious capital, students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six. Started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continued to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one. Weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly forbidden lest they, like for all, should prove too distracting, with the exception of a single laundress. And on the condition that she was over 50 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Adam Ferguson, a renowned Enlightenment philosopher, graduated in 1742. James Wilson, a founding father of the United States, studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD or Doctor of Medicine by the university, the French Revolutionary Jean Paul Marat in 1775 and in 1792 Edward Jenner, whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox. I need modern immunology. By the beginning of the 1800s, Saint Andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. A healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by way of the University Scotland Act of 1858 introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day. Women were admitted to full-time study in 1892 and by the 1900s student life Remember resembled many of our current graduands experiences. Perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of September 1911, which resemble our activities today. Planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests. Garden parties were spread across the town. Speeches were delivered. Representatives of 145 universities in learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed. A student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the Belle Pettigrew Museum, and the town came to life with song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in June 1929. Its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes. It is therefore sight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving the hall and using their education to change the world for the better. As so many have done. Before them. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities. 2 years later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating crafts were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in July 2020, and thus the graduation ritual. Will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred, with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin I will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties, and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirm the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP to most, though I will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our daughters choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Professor Marcus Feldman. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is the assistant vice principal Dean of science, professor Inoca de Myrtle. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments, but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a Saint Andrian throughout your life.

Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science and all his kauser. Professor Marcus Feldman. Marcus Feldman is the Burnett C and Mildred Finley Walford professor of Biological Sciences at Stanford University, where he is also founder and director of the Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies and Co. Director of the Centre for Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics. Now a naturalized American. Feldman was born in Perth, Australia, in 1942. And after completing a degree in a masters in mathematics and statistics moved to Stanford University in California in the 1960s to carry out his PhD where he has been ever since. Rising to full professor in 1977, Feldman is now recognised as one of the world's leading theoretical biologists, renowned for his contributions to mathematical evolutionary theory. Feldman is the author of 15 books and some 700 scientific papers on evolution, ecology, mathematical biology and demography, including over 70 articles in nature science and in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. He is 1 / 30 major honours, including being an elected member of the US National Academy of Sciences. The Comira Muto Award in human evolution, and the Society for the Study of Evolutions Lifetime Achievement Award. He has made profound contributions to many areas of biology, including Human Genetics, the evolution of sex, recombination and epistasis. Nice construction theory and cultural evolution. His work has been cited over 75,000 times, which makes Feldman one of the most influential biologists on the planet. He has founded and been managing editor of leading biological journals and played a key role in the establishment of the Santa Fe Institute, the world's leading research centre for complexity science. Feldman is not only a visionary scientist, but a dedicated teacher who is also one of words for his awards for his service and mentorship. One of his most pleasing legacies is that his PhD students and postdoctoral researchers populate the biology faculties of universities around the world. Feldman is also a scientist with a well developed social conscience. He has taken a courageous stance in debunking bogus claims, linking race with intelligence and with other abilities and conditions. Conducting the important genetic analysis that invalidate a biological concept of race applied to humans and speaking out against scientific racism. However, it is his contributions to the field of cultural evolution that has been particularly important to researchers at the University of Saint Andrews. From the early 1970s, Feldman, together with fellow Stanford geneticist Luca Cavalli, Schwartzer began modelling cultural inheritance, cultural change over time, and the coevolutionary interactions between genes and culture. They're classic monograph, cultural transmission and evolution. Published in 1981, has been cited well over 5000 times alone. It's difficult to overstate the importance of these works, in which much of the formal machinery for the mathematical modelling of culture and gene culture coevolution is introduced. This body of theory has been used in a variety of ways, including partitioning the variants in behavioural and personality traits, addressing questions about the adaptive advantages of complex forms of phenotypic plasticity and investigating the evolution of particular traits ranging from language learning to conformity. Almost 50 years later, cultural evolution has blossomed into a major interdisciplinary field with its own own society. Formed in 2017, and an annual conference. As one of the world's leading centres of excellence for research into cultural evolution, the members of the Centre for Social Learning and Cognitive Evolution at Saint Andrews, which includes 23 staff collaborating across the schools of psychology and neuroscience and biology particularly appreciate Feldman's foundational contribution. Many researchers at Saint Andrews regularly used concepts, methods, and modelling techniques devised by Feldman in their work. The University of Saint Andrews International prominence in this field owes a debt to Feldman's colossal contribution. And it is fitting that this should be marked with an honorary degree. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to biology and in particular to the development of the field of cultural evolution. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science on Norris Kausa on Professor Marcus Feldman. Tay Aradam doctoris the NCI honoris causa from movie. Curious Ray in Symbolum Superette hope Berekum compono. Congratulations. It's a truly great honor to receive this degree from this wonderful university. Where the work on cultural evolution has reached new highs. To become one of the two or three leading institutions in the world in this field. And I've. Thoroughly enjoyed watching the growth of this discipline at Saint Andrews. And the eminence of the university as a whole. Really means a great deal to me in receiving this degree, and I thank you all for coming. And thank Kevin and Vice Principal, vice chancellor. Sorry and thank you all. I call upon the Assistant vice principal Dean of science, professor Inika demersal. Vice Chancellor's honoured guests colleagues graduates. First and foremost, of course. My warmest congratulations to all of you celebrating the award of your degree today. This day has certainly been a long time coming, but our joy and pride at being here with you today are no less. Congratulations are also still due to all the people who have supported you along the way. In getting here, family, friends, but also your lecturers and all the other staff in Saint Andrews who work tirelessly and often unnoticed to support you during your degree. Despite the familiar gordianus the gowns, the walk across the stage and the famous in Andrews cap, there is no way of ignoring that. This is not a traditional synandra's graduation. Graduation ceremonies usually marked both the end of an era and the start of something new. A mixture of joy and some trepidation about what comes next. Although that might not be quite true today, there's no loss of pride in your achievements, and we're glad to be celebrating with you. But as well as celebrating it is perhaps also an occasion to reflect, and the last two years have certainly given us a lot to reflect on. In March 2020, you were just weeks away from your final exams. You might already have planned parties, got tickets for the graduation ball. Your family and friends might have already organized their trip to join you here in Saint Andrews for your graduation ceremony. But then almost overnight, everything changed. We all went home and in those first few weeks, Saint Andrews became eerily quiet. Market Street was deserted, the beaches empty, apart from the occasional lone dog Walker and the seagulls deprived of their usual diet of discarded chips. We all adjust. It boots slowly and extraordinarily fast. Alongside caring for vulnerable family and friends and home schooling, children, staff and students alike got the grip with teams. Lectures, moved online exams moved online, meeting family and friends moved online. The IT systems creaked, but somehow held out. It was an extraordinary end to your degrees, and for most of you, your time in Saint Andrews. Although often overused, extraordinary Morden applies to your journey to be here in younger hall today. The intervening 2 years since you've graduated have been anything but normal or easy. But in the midst of all the difficulties the pandemic has brought. Are there not also some positives to hold on to? I suspect many of you will have her discovered resilience, an ability to adjust, and an inner strength you maybe did not know you had. The final part of the degree of your degree was certainly not what you expected, and you had to wait two years to get your moment crossing this stage. Many more of your plants will likely have changed, possibly several times. But if you can get a degree during a global pandemic, what else could you achieve? If we can individually and collectively respond to such large scale and sudden disruption, can we not also rise to other challenges which are looming large? The challenges facing your generation are substantial and it is easy to feel overwhelmed or powerless. And yet, did you not just walk across the stage here? Did we not respond to the pandemic collectively and look after each other? Shopping for elderly neighbours making masks. Simply reaching out to those who were struggling. Worldwide, the number of Community initiatives and individual gestures has been astonishing. I suspect many of you will agree that in some form or another you had to draw on your resilience to get to this day. But for me there was something else to be learned from the pandemic. Humility. Following from the realization that everything we might take for granted can suddenly come to a halt. That something so small as a virus can cause disruption on a global scale. So many things we would never give a second thought all at once had to be considered carefully. Should we see friends hug loved ones? Could we plan travel? We will be feeling the consequences of this pandemic for a long time to come, but I for one think that a little bit of humility, remembering not to take things for granted is perhaps not a bad thing. As well as the knowledge and skills for which you were awarded your degree basilians the ability to adjust and a bit of humility or qualities which we will be relying on during many occasions in the years to come. When things are going well for you, which I sincerely hope they will for every single one of you. Remember to occasionally pause and be grateful. And if at some point in life in future life is challenging you and you find yourself wondering how you gonna get through, remember your extraordinary journey to be here today. Although I firmly believe what I have just said, I also believe there's no need to test your resilience any further just now. So let me wrap up. Today might not be a traditional graduation ceremony, but all of you. Austin Andrews graduates. So let me thank you on behalf of all of us for coming back to Saint Andrews and letting us share in the celebration of your achievements. The last two years have been tough. But seeing all of you here today gives me confidence such an extraordinary group of graduates can get through anything, no matter how big the challenge. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis. In secular secularism, Amen."
