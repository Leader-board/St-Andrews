principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger wall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage the style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape the modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry ward law invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from penny scholar in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into the town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later of the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king robert the third and later as tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for eighteen years king james revisited saint andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas in fourteen twenty five and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the sixth of scotland and first of england visited saint andrews in sixteen seventeen and made a gift of two hundred volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in sixteen forty three on south street this was a key moment for the early library but one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary 's college from fifteen eighty and as rector from fifteen ninety melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen 's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony very much like this one in two thousand and five we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may twenty twenty one and earlier this month we unveiled a fortieth birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the universities ward law museum our recently redeveloped museum situated on the schools and which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of five to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is one from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities two years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july twenty twenty and thus the graduation ritual will today be on in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i would use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degrees twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans intern to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or beratung touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our theatres chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innis hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor linda mcdowell to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is the vice principle for education professor claire petty the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life dequina speckled artis artsiom vice chancellor i ask you to confirm the degree of master of arts general on sheena smith tay at gradom agistri altium confirmo que

of geography and sustainable development vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science honours kausa professor linda mcdowell professor mcdowell is one of the leading figures in academic geography she has held chairs at the universities of oxford the london school of economics and university college london she's authored ten research monographs added twelve edited twelve collections and has published more than a hundred and seventy peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters her work has been translated into nine languages she has been awarded two marks of distinction from the royal geographical society the back medal for contributions to economic geography in nineteen ninety eight and the victoria medal for research excellence in two thousand and eight in that year she was also elected to a fellowship by the british academy in two thousand and sixteen she was appointed commander of the british empire for services to geography and the social sciences and she has a son a daughter and six grandsons and i'm delighted that she is joined today by her husband chris professor mcdowell 's research has focused on understanding the pressing implications of economic and social restructuring in britain drawing attention to the stark geographical contrasts these processes generated and the impact they had on particular people whether the workplace identities of bankers in the city of london or less privileged young men or migrant women negotiating work in each case professor mcdowell has balanced intellectual insight with an exceptional attentiveness to the voices and experiences of those she had interviewed when professor mcdowell began her career geography was a gender blind discipline which characteristically studied man and environment her insistence on the need to recognise not just that women should be seen as worthy of academic study but also as producers of that knowledge has made the discipline a welcoming place for women and others who previously felt excluded from it professor mcdowell was the inaugural chair of the women and geography study group of the royal geographical society in nineteen eighty one and co wrote the first formal statement about the need for a feminist geography three years later throughout her career she has been an advocate of wider access to elite institutions and to encourage this has been involved in events with teachers local geographical societies and schools every discipline if it is to change needs a pioneer and a role model to inspire and guide future generations for many geographers professor mcdowell is that person indeed i am one of those geographers and if it were not for her encouragement in my early career i doubt i would be standing here as geographer royal for scotland today vice chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to geography i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science honours kausa on professor linda mcdowell tay edgardo M tori cnci honoris causa promoviendo pray in symbolum superette hope brighton imponent well what a pleasure it is to share this splendid day with you i hope it's the start of a well i was gonna say a long association with saint andrews but i don't think my association will be as long as yours i'm sure for many of you though it must be really wonderful coming back to this unique place i mean what a beautiful place saint andrews is and all those memories you've got of the three years or the six years or however many years you've spent here what i want to do is wish you the best of luck in everything you're doing now and what you might do in the future but to emphasise what the vice chancellor said earlier that your association with saint andrews will be forever but your excellent education your resilience that you developed during that year of covid but above all the network of friends and contacts that you made while you've been a student here will stand you in good stead through the rest of your life i'm so proud to be able to count myself among you and alumna that's the feminine you men are alumnus or alumni and i just want to say many many congratulations well done to all of you and perhaps a nod to your parents and friends that helped you through it thank you for this wonderful honour i call upon the vice principal education and proctor professor claire petty vice chancellor colleagues special guests and graduates i have the honour of being one of the first to congratulate you on your success today i cannot even begin to express how delighted we all are to welcome you back to your university and to complete your journey by celebrating your graduation in person and the way that was always intended this is your very special day one of the few days in your life which is entirely focused on your own personal achievement i know you are also very excited about today and quite rightly so however i also know how innovative you are when it comes to organizing a party so i've no doubt that you have found your own way to reconnect with your friends and recover some of those missed magical moments i am therefore also sure that some of you are feeling slightly worse today than you might have imagined rest assured i'm not going to talk for very long so you'll very soon be out in the fresh air recently in my fullest role as vice principal education i found myself defending the intangible benefits of your university education explaining that the attributes you've gained from your degree are so much more than the knowledge you've gained with each of your mod within each of your modules when john dewey american philosopher and educational reformer said education is not preparation for life but education is life itself he was alluding to the concept that education provides a capacity that will serve you throughout your lives i truly believe that the attributes you take with you as you graduate today are more about the ability to learn something new to interpret to synthesise to analyse to question and to reflect these are the skills that you will use to contribute to the social economic and sustainable future of our world no matter what your chosen journey is these graduate attributes come not only from your academic studies but also for your contribution to that and intangible fantastic student experience this is the experience that makes you so proud to be graduates of saint andrews your contributions to this experience may well have been through volunteering and supporting your friends and caring for your academic family engaging in sport valuing diversity contributing to student representation well perhaps organizing an inclusive social event the good news is that this intangible magic doesn't leave you today as a graduate of saint andrews myself and the mother of two graduates of saint andrews i personally observed how the magic of being a member of this really special community and the attributes you have gained will be with you for the rest of your lives one attribute that you have specially gained is that of resilience the ability to achieve success while facing environmental diversity within the highly collaborative scottish higher education sector groups from different universities have recognised the importance of resilience and we've been working together to understand and support our academic communities throughout the pandemic historically in saint andrews being resilient to plague and disaster is nothing new to students at saint andrews in the fifteenth century the community will have experienced two bouts of plague and english invasion in fourteen eighty two and in the sixteenth century saint andrews experienced lots of religious murder and strife with plenty of martyrs on both sides and a siege of the castle and sixteen forty five the great plague killed thousands of people across scotland and five years later we had another english invasion in the sixteen nineties the whole of scotland more or less went bankrupt and it was scotland 's coldest decade and famine issued thereafter things calmed down a little bit until the twentieth century when we had the spanish flu in this historical context the covid pandemic could see not much more than a minor convenience inconvenience nevertheless the pan pandemic challenged your resilience as students when you had to pivot online learning and finish your studies and be here to celebrate graduation today at this point i need to pause briefly to offer an apology to those supporters and families who back in the second semester of twenty twenty were enjoying a blissfully quiet time free of mounds of clothes to be washed free of piles of encrusted cereal bowls and empty fridges and then suddenly found themselves with unexpected returners to the household it was a really difficult time for everyone and thank you so much will for working with us as we navigated through the early lockdown in the pandemic we showed that at saint andrews we are at all indeed nabad in a crisis and on your behalf i want to thank all the academics and professional service staffer who in a matter of days managed to provide the last weeks of teaching set your final examinations and confer your degrees online they were exceptional in the way they did everything they needed to support your studies and i think we should thank them very much i am hoping that now when you return to saint andrews this week you find a town that is emerging and realise that it will remain a great constant in your life we are always here and you are always very welcome back as educators it always makes us really happy to hear about your journey after we have finished our part in your life and crossing the stage today you have already demonstrated astonishing resilience and now you can continue to proudly demonstrate the intangible magical attributes of your educational here educational experience here at the university wherever you go and whatever you do congratulations please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular

scotland's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in 1318 university instruction commenced here in may 1410 when our founder bishop henry ward law invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from penny scholar in august 1413 which were met by great jubilation when carried into the town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later of the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king robert the 3rd and later as tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for 18 years king james revisited st andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas in 1425 and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the 6th of scotland and 1st of england visited st andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in 1643 on south st this was a key moment for the early library but one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary's college from 1580 and as rector from 1590 melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony very much like this one in 2005 we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may 2021 and earlier this month we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the universities ward law museum our recently redeveloped museum situated on the schools and which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of five to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is 1 from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities 2 years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july 2020 and thus the graduation ritual will today be on in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i would use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degrees twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans intern to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or beratung touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our theatres chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innis hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor linda mcdowell to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is the vice principle for education professor claire petty the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life dequina speckled artis artsiom vice chancellor i ask you to confirm the

universities of oxford the london school of economics and university college london she's authored 10 research monographs added 12 edited 12 collections and has published more than 170 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters her work has been translated into 9 languages she has been awarded 2 marks of distinction from the royal geographical society the back medal for contributions to economic geography in 1998 and the victoria medal for research excellence in 2008 in that year she was also elected to a fellowship by the british academy in 2016 she was appointed commander of the british empire for services to geography and the social sciences and she has a son a daughter and six grandsons and i'm delighted that she is joined today by her husband chris professor mcdowell's research has focused on understanding the pressing implications of economic and social restructuring in britain drawing attention to the stark geographical contrasts these processes generated and the impact they had on particular people whether the workplace identities of bankers in the city of london or less privileged young men or migrant women negotiating work in each case professor mcdowell has balanced intellectual insight with an exceptional attentiveness to the voices and experiences of those she had interviewed when professor mcdowell began her career geography was a gender blind discipline which characteristically studied man and environment her insistence on the need to recognise not just that women should be seen as worthy of academic study but also as producers of that knowledge has made the discipline a welcoming place for women and others who previously felt excluded from it professor mcdowell was the inaugural chair of the women and geography study group of the royal geographical society in 1981 and co wrote the first formal statement about the need for a feminist geography 3 years later throughout her career she has been an advocate of wider access to elite institutions and to encourage this has been involved in events with teachers local geographical societies and schools every discipline if it is to change needs a pioneer and a role model to inspire and guide future generations for many geographers professor mcdowell is that person indeed i am one of those geographers and if it were not for her encouragement in my early career i doubt i would be

the start of a well i was gonna say a long association with saint andrews but i don't think my association will be as long as yours i'm sure for many of you though it must be really wonderful coming back to this unique place i mean what a beautiful place saint andrews is and all those memories you've got of the three years or the six years or however many years you've spent here what i want to do is wish you the best of luck in everything you're doing now and what you might do in the future but to emphasise what the vice chancellor said earlier that your association with saint andrews will be forever but your excellent education your resilience that you developed during that year of covid but above all the network of friends and contacts that you made while you've been a student here will stand you in good stead through the rest of your life i'm so proud to be able to count myself among you and alumna that's the feminine you men are alumnus or alumni and i just want to say many many congratulations well done to all of you and perhaps a nod to your parents and friends that helped you through it thank you for this wonderful honour i call upon the vice principal education and proctor professor claire petty vice chancellor colleagues special guests and graduates i have the honour of being one of the first to congratulate you on your success today i cannot even begin to express how delighted we all are to welcome you back to your university and to complete your journey by celebrating your graduation in person and the way that was always intended this is your very special day one of the few days in your life which is entirely focused on your own personal achievement i know you are also very excited about today and quite rightly so however i also know how innovative you are when it comes to organizing a party so i've no doubt that you have found your own way to reconnect with your friends and recover some of those missed magical moments i am therefore also sure that some of you are feeling slightly worse today than you might have imagined rest assured i'm not going to talk for very long so you'll very soon be out in the fresh air recently in my fullest role as vice principal education i found myself defending the intangible benefits of your university education explaining that the attributes you've gained from your degree are so much more than the knowledge you've gained with each of your mod within each of your modules when john dewey american philosopher and educational reformer said education is not preparation for life but education is life itself he was alluding to the concept that education provides a capacity that will serve you throughout your lives i truly believe that the attributes you take with you as you graduate today are more about the ability to learn something new to interpret to synthesise to analyse to question and to reflect these are the skills that you will use to contribute to the social economic and sustainable future of our world no matter what your chosen journey is these graduate attributes come not only from your academic studies but also for your contribution to that and intangible fantastic student experience this is the experience that makes you so proud to be graduates of saint andrews your contributions to this experience may well have been through volunteering and supporting your friends and caring for your academic family engaging in sport valuing diversity contributing to student representation well perhaps organizing an inclusive social event the good news is that this intangible magic doesn't leave you today as a graduate of saint andrews myself and the mother of two graduates of saint andrews i personally observed how the magic of being a member of this really special community and the attributes you have gained will be with you for the rest of your lives one attribute that you have specially gained is that of resilience the ability to achieve success while facing environmental diversity within the highly collaborative scottish higher education sector groups from different universities have recognised the importance of resilience and we've been working together to understand and support our academic communities throughout the pandemic historically in saint andrews being resilient to plague and disaster is nothing new to students at saint andrews in the 15th century the community will have experienced 2 bouts of plague and english invasion in 1482 and in the 16th century st andrews experienced lots of religious murder and strife with plenty of martyrs on both sides and a siege of the castle and 1645 the great plague killed thousands of people across scotland and five years later we had another english invasion in the 1690s the whole of scotland more or less went bankrupt and it was scotland's coldest decade and famine issued thereafter things calmed down a little bit until the 20th century when we had the spanish flu in this historical context the covid pandemic could see not much more than a minor convenience inconvenience nevertheless the pan pandemic challenged your resilience as students when you had to pivot online learning and finish your studies and be here to celebrate graduation today at this point i need to pause briefly to offer an apology to those supporters and families who back in the second semester of 2020 were enjoying a blissfully quiet time free of mounds of clothes to be washed free of piles of encrusted cereal bowls and empty fridges and then suddenly found themselves with unexpected returners to the household it was a really difficult time for everyone and thank you so much will for working with us as we navigated through the early lockdown in the pandemic we showed that at saint andrews we are at all indeed nabad in a crisis and on your behalf i want to thank all the academics and professional service staffer who in a matter of days managed to provide the last weeks of teaching set your final examinations and confer your degrees online they were exceptional in the way they did everything they needed to support your studies and i think we should thank them very much i am hoping that now when you return to saint andrews this week you find a town that is emerging and realise that it will remain a great constant in your life we are always here and you are always very welcome back as educators it always makes us really happy to hear about your journey after we have finished our part in your life and crossing the stage today you have already demonstrated astonishing resilience and now you can continue to proudly demonstrate the intangible magical attributes of your educational here educational experience here at the university wherever you go and whatever you do congratulations please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum

It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger wall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage. The style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape. The modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Ward law invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Penny Scholar in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into the town the following February. The royal leaders of Scotland and later of the United Kingdom have been a guiding, enriching and at times challenging presence in our history. Saint Andrews was the spiritual home of Scotland and on occasion hosted the Scottish Court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the Royal household. Our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, served as an adviser and diplomat to King Robert the 3rd and later as tutor and Protector to his son, the future King James, the first of Scotland, who resided with him in Saint Andrews Castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to France, which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in England for 18 years. King James Revisited St. Andrews throughout his life celebrating Christmas. In 1425, and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to Perth. His request was dutifully and happily ignored. Our university library, the oldest continuous library in Scotland, is indebted to royal patronage. King James, the 6th of Scotland and 1st of England visited St. Andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the University Library, a building in his honour. To accommodate this collection, the King James Library was completed in 1643 on South St. This was a key moment for the early library, but one suspects that King James was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign. King James clashed repeatedly with Andrew Melville, a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as Principal of Saint Mary's College from 1580 and as rector from 1590. Melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university, but was resistant to royal interference. Given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether, King James locked Melville in the Tower of London. Royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to Lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence. We enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating Her Majesty the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. We have been honoured by the presence of Her Majesty periodically throughout her reign, most recently at the graduation of our alumni, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a graduation ceremony. Very much like this one in 2005 we were delighted to welcome their Royal Highnesses back to the university for a visit in May 2021. And earlier this month, we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge at the Universities Ward Law Museum. Our recently redeveloped museum, situated on the schools and which is well worth a visit. In crossing today's stage, each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps, but also in the footsteps of the academics, leaders and Changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of five to shape the world in profound ways. The journey you make from here is yours to envisage, but their example is 1, from which we can all draw inspiration. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities. 2 years later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in July 2020, and thus the graduation ritual will today be. On in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I would use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degrees twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans intern to present candidates from their respective faculties and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirm the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP to most, though I will simply say. At Super Tay, meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or beratung touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our theatres Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude, and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innis Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Professor Linda McDowell. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is the vice principle for education Professor Claire Petty. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews, and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

I call upon Professor Joe Sharp of the School of Geography and Sustainable Development. Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science honours kausa professor Linda McDowell. Professor McDowell is one of the leading figures in academic geography. She has held chairs at the Universities of Oxford, the London School of Economics, and University College London. She's authored 10 research monographs, added 12 edited 12 collections, and has published more than 170 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters. Her work has been translated into 9 languages. She has been awarded 2 marks of distinction from the Royal Geographical Society. The back medal for contributions to economic geography in 1998 and the Victoria Medal for Research Excellence in 2008. In that year she was also elected to a fellowship by the British Academy. In 2016, she was appointed commander of the British Empire for services to geography and the social sciences. And she has a son, a daughter and six grandsons, and I'm delighted that she is joined today by her husband Chris. Professor Mcdowell's research has focused on understanding the pressing implications of economic and social restructuring in Britain, drawing attention to the stark geographical contrasts these processes generated, and the impact they had on particular people, whether the workplace identities of bankers in the City of London or less privileged young men or migrant women negotiating work. In each case, Professor McDowell has balanced intellectual insight with an exceptional attentiveness to the voices and experiences of those she had interviewed. When Professor McDowell began her career, geography was a gender blind discipline which, characteristically studied man and environment. Her insistence on the need to recognise not just that women should be seen as worthy of academic study, but also as producers of that knowledge, has made the discipline a welcoming place for women and others who previously felt excluded from it. Professor McDowell was the inaugural chair of the Women and Geography Study Group of the Royal Geographical Society in 1981 and Co. Wrote the first formal statement about the need for a feminist geography 3 years later. Throughout her career she has been an advocate of wider access to elite institutions and to encourage this has been involved in events with teachers, local geographical societies and schools. Every discipline, if it is to change, needs a pioneer and a role model to inspire and guide future generations. For many geographers, Professor McDowell is that person. Indeed, I am one of those geographers, and if it were not for her encouragement in my early career, I doubt I would be standing here as geographer Royal for Scotland today. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of her major contribution to geography, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science honours kausa on Professor Linda McDowell. Tay, Edgardo M Tori Cnci honoris causa promoviendo pray in symbolum superette hope Brighton imponent. Well, what a pleasure it is to share this splendid day with you. I hope it's the start of a well I was gonna say a long association with Saint Andrews, but I don't think my association will be as long as yours. I'm sure for many of you though, it must be really wonderful. Coming back to this unique place. I mean what a beautiful place Saint Andrews is. And all those memories you've got of the three years or the six years or however many years you've spent here. What I want to do is wish you the best of luck in everything you're doing now and what you might do in the future. But to emphasise what the Vice chancellor said earlier that your association with Saint Andrews will be forever. But your excellent education. Your resilience that you developed during that year of COVID, but above all, the network of friends and contacts that you made while you've been a student here will stand you in good stead through the rest of your life. I'm so proud to be able to count myself among you and alumna. That's the feminine you men are alumnus or alumni. And I just want to say many many congratulations. Well done to all of you, and perhaps a nod to your parents and friends that helped you through it. Thank you for this wonderful honour. I call upon the vice principal education and Proctor Professor Claire Petty. Vice Chancellor, colleagues, special guests and graduates. I have the honour of being one of the first to congratulate you on your success today. I cannot even begin to express how delighted we all are to welcome you back to your university and to complete your journey. By celebrating your graduation in person and the way that was always intended, this is your very special day. One of the few days in your life which is entirely focused on your own personal achievement. I know you are also very excited about today and quite rightly so. However, I also know how innovative you are when it comes to organizing a party, so I've no doubt that you have found your own way to reconnect with your friends and recover some of those missed magical moments. I am therefore also sure that some of you are feeling slightly worse today than you might have imagined. Rest assured, I'm not going to talk for very long, so you'll very soon be out in the fresh air. Recently in my fullest role as Vice principal education, I found myself defending the intangible benefits of your university education, explaining that the attributes you've gained from your degree are so much more than the knowledge you've gained with each of your mod within each of your modules. When John Dewey, American philosopher and educational reformer, said education is not preparation for life but education is life itself, he was alluding to the concept that education provides a capacity that will serve you throughout your lives. I truly believe that the attributes you take with you as you graduate today are more about the ability to learn something new, to interpret, to synthesise, to analyse to question and to reflect. These are the skills that you will use to contribute to the social, economic and sustainable future of our world. No matter what your chosen journey is. These graduate attributes come not only from your academic studies, but also for your contribution to that and intangible fantastic student experience. This is the experience that makes you so proud to be graduates of Saint Andrews. Your contributions to this experience may well have been through volunteering and supporting your friends and caring for your academic family, engaging in sport, valuing diversity, contributing to student representation. Well, perhaps organizing an inclusive social event? The good news is that this intangible magic doesn't leave you today. As a graduate of Saint Andrews, myself and the mother of two graduates of Saint Andrews, I personally observed how the magic of being a member of this really special community and the attributes you have gained will be with you for the rest of your lives. One attribute that you have specially gained is that of resilience. The ability to achieve success while facing environmental diversity. Within the highly collaborative Scottish higher education sector, groups from different universities have recognised the importance of resilience and we've been working together to understand and support our academic communities throughout the pandemic. Historically, in Saint Andrews being resilient to plague and disaster is nothing new to students at Saint Andrews in the 15th century. The community will have experienced 2 bouts of plague and English invasion in 1482, and in the 16th century. St. Andrews experienced lots of religious murder and strife with plenty of martyrs on both sides and a siege of the castle. And 1645 the Great Plague killed thousands of people across Scotland and five years later we had another English invasion in the 1690s. The whole of Scotland more or less went bankrupt, and it was Scotland's coldest decade and famine issued. Thereafter, things calmed down a little bit until the 20th century when we had the Spanish flu. In this historical context, the COVID pandemic could see not much more than a minor convenience inconvenience. Nevertheless, the PAN pandemic challenged your resilience as students when you had to pivot online learning and finish your studies and be here to celebrate graduation today. At this point I need to pause briefly to offer an apology to those supporters and families who back in the second semester of 2020, were enjoying a blissfully quiet time free of mounds of clothes to be washed free of piles of encrusted cereal bowls and empty fridges, and then suddenly found themselves with unexpected returners to the household. It was a really difficult time for everyone, and thank you so much. Will for working with us as we navigated through the early lockdown. In the pandemic, we showed that at Saint Andrews we are at all indeed nabad in a crisis and on your behalf. I want to thank all the academics and professional service staffer who, in a matter of days, managed to provide the last weeks of teaching set your final examinations and confer your degrees online. They were exceptional in the way they did everything they needed to support your studies, and I think we should thank them very much. I am hoping that now when you return to Saint Andrews this week, you find a town that is emerging and realise that it will remain a great constant in your life. We are always here and you are always very welcome back. As educators, it always makes us really happy to hear about your journey. After we have finished our part in your life. And crossing the stage today, you have already demonstrated astonishing resilience. And now you can continue to proudly demonstrate the intangible magical attributes of your educational here. Educational experience here at the university wherever you go and whatever you do, congratulations. Please stand for the benediction. Grazia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi, at Caritas de, at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum, omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen."
