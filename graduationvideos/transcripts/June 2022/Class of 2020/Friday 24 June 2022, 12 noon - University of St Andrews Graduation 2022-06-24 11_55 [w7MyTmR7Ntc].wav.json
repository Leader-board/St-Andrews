the university good afternoon everyone it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the building is fully accessible to all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a center for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of fifteenth century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history the scotty chronicon which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that saint rule was born in circa three hundred AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited one evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint louis brought the relics which constituted one tooth one kneecap one humerus and saint andrews right hand to what bauer describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation 's patron saint the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued saint andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its six hundred years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the fifteenth century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in fourteen seventy nine and fourteen ninety four respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas 's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar 's poetry was amongst the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in fifteen oh eight and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin ennead into scots completing this in fifteen thirteen these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of saint leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the sixth of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal masks and and poems including a special commission for the wedding married to lord darnley in fifteen sixty five later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin pertry deliciae portalarium scoutorama was sponsored by a graduate at early cilantro gist of our university john scott in sixteen thirty seven and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from fifteen sorry from seventeen sixty five to seventeen sixty eight and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers the tree life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by willow mure an early female graduate of our university in nineteen ten who with her husband edwin translated works by luminaries such as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that the measures perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today hosts some of the world 's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creativity ingenuity and critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since salvatore's chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor it is my pleasure to welcome you all after which the confirmation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence this ceremony recognizes that the class of twenty twenty was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that poor city of quintessential festivities two years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july twenty twenty and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which the chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour warwick hall to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation due to the indisposition of today's scheduled speaker professor sean allen from the school of modern languages i will return to deliver the graduation address the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrew throughout your life decanus faculty artus

of doctor of letters honoris kyosei warwick bull warwick ball is an archaeologist of the near east and central asia with a particular interest in afghanistan he is a teacher writer and explorer a prolific author whose career is testament to the fact that pathways to intellectual innovation and success are rarely orthodox that to push the boundaries of the envelope one must frequently venture to the frontiers both geographically and intellectually of knowledge warwick began his career in archaeology when he went to join the excavations at seraf in southern iran during his gap year at the age of nineteen he never looked back avoiding the traditional path of a university degree warwick decided instead to stay in the field extending his interest into afghanistan in nineteen seventy two a country for which he would discover among the many artifacts and abiding interests and affection he served as the last effective director of the british institute of afghan studies being one of the last western archaeologists to leave the country in nineteen eighty one it also convinced him that the approaches to the archaeology and history of the near east lent too heavily in a eurocentric direction most obviously the conventional understanding of the roman empire it is no exaggeration to say that warwick 's work brought afghanistan in from the margins to its rightful place as a key player in the history of eurasia with further work in excavations in syria libya ethiopia jordan and iraq warrick effectively and cogently argued for a more cosmopolitan interpretation of developments is chewing simple explanations warwick sought to reflect the complex dynamics at work in the movements of peoples and ideas across eurasia the spread in particular religious ideas including the fact that buddhism spread west before it spread east and the role of women in the adoption of christianity in rome his many books and publications include excavations at kandahar cairo to kabul ancient settlement in the zamara region syria and architectural and historical guide the monument of afghanistan rome in the east the transformation of an empire awarded the james henry breasted history prize the archaeological gazeteer of afghanistan the archaeology of afghanistan and the eurasian steppe people movement ideas his keen interest in the question of european identity and the impact of the easter explored in a quartet of books published between two thousand and nine and twenty fifteen under the rubric of asia and europe and the making of the west in nineteen ninety four warwick founded eastern approaches a special interest heritage tour operator taking his first tour to north eastern iran his final tour in twenty sixteen was to northern china taking a party from xanadu to the jade gate despite having formally retired in twenty sixteen warwick remains very much active in the field founding the journal afghanistan in twenty eighteen and publishing east of the wardrobe the unexpected worlds of CS lewis an investigation into the eastern religious elements in the writing of CS lewis in twenty twenty two chancellor for his tireless efforts in expanding the horizons of our understanding of the east and its profound impact on the west i invite you to confer after a fifty two year gap year the degree of doctor of letters on arris kausa on warwick bull taylor 's growth and told us letter arum and noras kaiser promoviendo curious ray and symbolum silhouette whoopee retim imponent installations well stunning here i feel a little bit of a cheat being probably the only person in this room who's never been to university well i do say probably because my granddaughter also happens to be here and she's also never been to university but she's just one having taken a gap year after leaving school it has somehow extended to fifty two years having finally been awarded a degree i feel like now ought to go out and get a proper job but it also makes my admiration all the more for your yourselves for achieving in just a few years what has taken me fifty two years to do it's a fantastic achievement which i more than anybody else can appreciate congratulations it also makes my admiration humbly all the more to this ancient university for awarding someone who has gone against a system which this university has helped put into place i thank the university from the bottom of my heart for this honour but this makes any advice that i can give to new graduates all the more heartfelt whatever lies ahead remember there are many ways to roam at many doors and to narnia you don't have to go down the well trodden road at all you can be unconventional and against the grain also works thank you i call upon the principle of the university it now falls upon me to deliver today's graduation address and it is conventional to begin with a wholehearted and emphatic note of congratulations to our graduates you have done it in attaining your degree you completed an intellectual journey that has demanded sustained investment across many months or years as well as intellectual curiosity and sheer hard work these capabilities were sharpened during your programme and you are better equipped for what comes next indeed better able to envisage and create your own path a degree from saint andrews is not easily gained but it is something that you have earned and which nobody can take away from you you and your friends families teachers and peers have every right to feel very proud today you also have more to celebrate than most for the final few months of your degree programme the pandemic ruptured the conventional delivery of teaching and demanded that you exercise greater dexterity than any of your forebears i know it was not simple but in coming through a time of great challenge with something of equally great value to show for it you demonstrated a quintessentially saint andrews spirit of endeavour and excellence during some of the most severe lockdowns necessitated by the pandemic whether spent in saint andrews or elsewhere reading and learning were two of the great reliefs of daily life for many of us they were supplemented by exercise i was in saint andrews throughout the pandemic years an exercise here first took the form of our daily government allocated thirty minute dash out of the house which later proliferated when outdoor activities were increasingly enabled into much longer stretches of walking hiking and running a poor city of tourists and at times students and staff made saint andrews a quiet place for those of us who remained but its beaches and streets were unfailingly punctuated by people running or walking their way through the anxieties of the moment this draws upon a long tradition of exercise at saint andrews in which running has been used as a way to offset the stresses of studying by generations of students before your enrollment here some of your attending guests may have been more familiar with our town as either the home of golf or as the setting of the opening scene of the nineteen eighty one film chariots of fire that sequence in which a group of students run along west sands toward saint andrews is one of the most iconic cinematic visuals in western film and it is accompanied by an equally iconic school by the composer vangelis who passed away just last month it is a scene recreated consciously or otherwise hundreds of times every day by the students who run across the sands and with more deliberate intent at the annual chariots of fire five K beach race the latest iteration of this event took place at the beginning of this month and it brought together seven hundred staff students in townsfolk for a community celebration of exercise in the landscape that we are so fortunate to inhabit further sources of athletic inspiration are present on our stage that makes a number of people behind me nervous but let me explain what i'm talking about but particularly in our honourable chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem lord campbell is a polymath of renown a lawyer by training a parliamentarian of historic significance and an incisive foreign affairs and defence specialist lord campbell serves to this day as a member of the nato parliamentary assembly as part of the UK delegation that he led from twenty twenty twenty ten to twenty fifteen lord campbell is however also an olympian of equally historic proportions he competed at the nineteen sixty four tokyo olympics including in the four by one hundred metre relay at which he and his team established a new british record lord campbell subsequently competed in the nineteen sixty six commonwealth games he later defeated OJ simpson in a competitive one hundred metre race in nineteen sixty seven and from nineteen sixty seven to nineteen seventy four he held he held the national one hundred metre record in his autobiography published in two thousand and eight lord campbell recalls his feelings upon leaving tokyo as an olympian writing i worked for it dreamed of it and finally achieved it i remember it vividly as if it were yesterday like running studying is about perseverance about getting to the library or laboratory every day and doing the work it can often be a solitary activity and its rewards do not immediately manifest one must simply trust that through repeated labour and constant endeavour a transformation occurs by degrees that through time leads both to a distinct sharpening of one 's capabilities and the discovery of new understandings every assignment you completed every page you read or every experiment you conducted placed you one foot further forward and today we mark your completion of the race running is not an activity that everyone enjoys some of you will default to other sports or the gentler pleasures of walking but every academic can relate to the central ethos of running a will towards self improvement that is wonderfully described by the japanese novelist haruki murakami in his two thousand and seven memoir what i talk about when i talk about running i'm quoting running day after day piling up the races bit by bit i raised the bar and by clearing each level i elevate myself the point is whether or not i'm proved over yesterday in long distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself the way you used to be your time studying as part of the class of your year group is over while you will will always be part of the rich and inclusive alumni community the track ahead is one that you must pursue alone guided by your principles and impulses that is a daunting prospect but also a tremendously exciting one it's time to set your own standards and aspirations saint andrews has equipped you with the skills knowledge and perseverance necessary to excel in anything you wish to pursue and the future lies ahead so run towards it for the prize is yours to take thank you well i must thank the principal for her generous references to me it was a long time ago but i still remember it as if it were yesterday please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis and secular secularism ohmen",

peniscola in august 1413 which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history the scotty chronicon which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that st rule was born in circa 300 AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited 1 evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint louis brought the relics which constituted one tooth 1 kneecap 1 humerus and saint andrews right hand to what bauer describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation's patron st the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued st andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its 600 years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in 1479 and 1494 respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar's poetry was amongst the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in 1508 and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin ennead into scots completing this in 1513 these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of st leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the 6th of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal masks and and poems including a special commission for the wedding married to lord darnley in 1565 later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin pertry deliciae portalarium scoutorama was sponsored by a graduate at early cilantro gist of our university john scott in 1637 and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from 15 sorry from 1765 to 1768 and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers the tree life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by willow mure an early female graduate of our university in 1910 who with her husband edwin translated works by luminaries such as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that the measures perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today hosts some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creativity ingenuity and critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since salvatore's chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor it is my pleasure to welcome you all after which the confirmation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence this ceremony recognizes that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that poor city of quintessential festivities 2 years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july 2020 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which the chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour warwick hall to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation due to the indisposition of today's scheduled speaker professor sean allen from the school of modern languages i will return to deliver the graduation address the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrew throughout your life decanus

particular interest in afghanistan he is a teacher writer and explorer a prolific author whose career is testament to the fact that pathways to intellectual innovation and success are rarely orthodox that to push the boundaries of the envelope one must frequently venture to the frontiers both geographically and intellectually of knowledge warwick began his career in archaeology when he went to join the excavations at seraf in southern iran during his gap year at the age of 19 he never looked back avoiding the traditional path of a university degree warwick decided instead to stay in the field extending his interest into afghanistan in 1972 a country for which he would discover among the many artifacts and abiding interests and affection he served as the last effective director of the british institute of afghan studies being one of the last western archaeologists to leave the country in 1981 it also convinced him that the approaches to the archaeology and history of the near east lent too heavily in a eurocentric direction most obviously the conventional understanding of the roman empire it is no exaggeration to say that warwick's work brought afghanistan in from the margins to its rightful place as a key player in the history of eurasia with further work in excavations in syria libya ethiopia jordan and iraq warrick effectively and cogently argued for a more cosmopolitan interpretation of developments is chewing simple explanations warwick sought to reflect the complex dynamics at work in the movements of peoples and ideas across eurasia the spread in particular religious ideas including the fact that buddhism spread west before it spread east and the role of women in the adoption of christianity in rome his many books and publications include excavations at kandahar cairo to kabul ancient settlement in the zamara region syria and architectural and historical guide the monument of afghanistan rome in the east the transformation of an empire awarded the james henry breasted history prize the archaeological gazeteer of afghanistan the archaeology of afghanistan and the eurasian steppe people movement ideas his keen interest in the question of european identity and the impact of the easter explored in a quartet of books published between 2009 and 2015 under the rubric of asia and europe and the making of the west in 1994 warwick founded eastern approaches a special interest heritage tour operator taking his first tour to north eastern iran his final tour in 2016 was to northern china taking a party from xanadu to the jade gate despite having formally retired in 2016 warwick remains very much active in the field founding the journal afghanistan in 2018 and publishing east of the wardrobe the unexpected worlds of CS lewis an investigation into the eastern religious elements in the writing of CS lewis in 2022 chancellor for his tireless efforts in expanding the horizons of our understanding of the east and its profound impact on the

probably because my granddaughter also happens to be here and she's also never been to university but she's just one having taken a gap year after leaving school it has somehow extended to 52 years having finally been awarded a degree i feel like now ought to go out and get a proper job but it also makes my admiration all the more for your yourselves for achieving in just a few years what has taken me 52 years to do it's a fantastic achievement which i more than anybody else can appreciate congratulations it also makes my admiration humbly all the more to this ancient university for awarding someone who has gone against a system which this university has helped put into place i thank the university from the bottom of my heart for this honour but this makes any advice that i can give to new graduates all the more heartfelt whatever lies ahead remember there are many ways to roam at many doors and to narnia you don't have to go down the well trodden rd at all you can be unconventional and against the grain also works thank you i call upon the principle of the university it now falls upon me to deliver today's graduation address and it is conventional to begin with a wholehearted and emphatic note of congratulations to our graduates you have done it in attaining your degree you completed an intellectual journey that has demanded sustained investment across many months or years as well as intellectual curiosity and sheer hard work these capabilities were sharpened during your programme and you are better equipped for what comes next indeed better able to envisage and create your own path a degree from saint andrews is not easily gained but it is something that you have earned and which nobody can take away from you you and your friends families teachers and peers have every right to feel very proud today you also have more to celebrate than most for the final few months of your degree programme the pandemic ruptured the conventional delivery of teaching and demanded that you exercise greater dexterity than any of your forebears i know it was not simple but in coming through a time of great challenge with something of equally great value to show for it you demonstrated a quintessentially st andrews spirit of endeavour and excellence during some of the most severe lockdowns necessitated by the pandemic whether spent in saint andrews or elsewhere reading and learning were two of the great reliefs of daily life for many of us they were supplemented by exercise i was in saint andrews throughout the pandemic years an exercise here first took the form of our daily government allocated 30 minute dash out of the house which later proliferated when outdoor activities were increasingly enabled into much longer stretches of walking hiking and running a poor city of tourists and at times students and staff made saint andrews a quiet place for those of us who remained but its beaches and streets were unfailingly punctuated by people running or walking their way through the anxieties of the moment this draws upon a long tradition of exercise at saint andrews in which running has been used as a way to offset the stresses of studying by generations of students before your enrollment here some of your attending guests may have been more familiar with our town as either the home of golf or as the setting of the opening scene of the 1981 film chariots of fire that sequence in which a group of students run along west sands toward saint andrews is one of the most iconic cinematic visuals in western film and it is accompanied by an equally iconic school by the composer vangelis who passed away just last month it is a scene recreated consciously or otherwise hundreds of times every day by the students who run across the sands and with more deliberate intent at the annual chariots of fire 5K beach race the latest iteration of this event took place at the beginning of this month and it brought together 700 staff students in townsfolk for a community celebration of exercise in the landscape that we are so fortunate to inhabit further sources of athletic inspiration are present on our stage that makes a number of people behind me nervous but let me explain what i'm talking about but particularly in our honourable chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem lord campbell is a polymath of renown a lawyer by training a parliamentarian of historic significance and an incisive foreign affairs and defence specialist lord campbell serves to this day as a member of the nato parliamentary assembly as part of the UK delegation that he led from 2020 2010 to 2015 lord campbell is however also an olympian of equally historic proportions he competed at the 1964 tokyo olympics including in the four by 100 metre relay at which he and his team established a new british record lord campbell subsequently competed in the 1966 commonwealth games he later defeated OJ simpson in a competitive 100 metre race in 1967 and from 1967 to 1974 he held he held the national 100 metre record in his autobiography published in 2008 lord campbell recalls his feelings upon leaving tokyo as an olympian writing i worked for it dreamed of it and finally achieved it i remember it vividly as if it were yesterday like running studying is about perseverance about getting to the library or laboratory every day and doing the work it can often be a solitary activity and its rewards do not immediately manifest one must simply trust that through repeated labour and constant endeavour a transformation occurs by degrees that through time leads both to a distinct sharpening of 1's capabilities and the discovery of new understandings every assignment you completed every page you read or every experiment you conducted placed you one foot further forward and today we mark your completion of the race running is not an activity that everyone enjoys some of you will default to other sports or the gentler pleasures of walking but every academic can relate to the central ethos of running a will towards self improvement that is wonderfully described by the japanese novelist haruki murakami in his 2007 memoir what i talk about when i talk about running i'm quoting running day after day piling up the races bit by bit i raised the bar and by clearing each level i elevate myself the point is whether or not i'm proved over yesterday in long distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself the way you used to be your time studying as part of the class of your year group is over while you will will always be part of the rich and inclusive alumni community the track ahead is one that you must pursue alone guided by your principles and impulses that is a daunting prospect but also a tremendously exciting one it's time to set your own standards and aspirations st andrews has equipped you with the skills knowledge and perseverance necessary to excel in anything you wish to pursue and the future lies ahead so run towards it for the prize is yours to take thank you well i must thank the principal for her generous references to me it was a long time ago but i still remember it as if it were yesterday please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis and secular secularism ohmen",

Please be seated. I call upon the principle of the university. Good afternoon everyone. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions, and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the building is fully accessible to all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception. And our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a Center for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. Walter Bauer, a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century Scotland, described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of Scottish history, the Scotty Chronicon, which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination. Legend has it that St Rule was born in circa 300 AD and was a Bishop in Patras, Greece, when he was visited 1 evening by an Angel who instructed him to take the bones of Saint Andrew far from the reach of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. Saint Louis brought the relics, which constituted one tooth, 1 kneecap, 1 humerus and Saint Andrews right hand to what Bauer describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun. And it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in Saint Andrews, which have proven so formative for contemporary Scotland, developed with Saint Andrew, later becoming the nation's patron St. The lyrical origins of our town and university imbued St. Andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a Crucible for literary creativity. Throughout its 600 years. Walter Bowers Mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas, who graduated in 1479 and 1494, respectively, and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early Modern Scotland. Dunbar, and Douglas's use of Scots was foundational for much literature that followed. Dunbar's poetry was amongst the first items printed in Scotland by the Edinburgh Printers, Chapman and Miller in 1508, and Douglas was the first translator of VERGIL'S Latin Ennead into Scots. Completing this in 1513. These were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university, including one who would become Principal of St. Leonards College, George Buchanan. The most significant Latin poet of his time. Buchanan was amongst many occupations, a tutor to Mary, Queen of Scots and later King James, the 6th of Scotland, and he served as a poet at Mary's Court, in which capacity he wrote many royal masks and and poems including a special Commission for the wedding. Married to Lord Darnley in 1565. Later generations were equally influential. The first major printed anthology of Scottish Latin Pertry Deliciae Portalarium Scoutorama was sponsored by a graduate at early cilantro. Gist of our university John Scott in 1637. And while we cannot claim to have educated Robert Burns who lived degree less to his end days, Saint Andrews was the academic home of the Scottish poet Robert Ferguson, who studied here from 15 sorry. From 1765 to 1768 and whom Burns held in higher esteem than all other writers. The tree life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by Willow Mure, an early female graduate of our university in 1910, who with her husband Edwin, translated works by luminaries such as Herman Brooke and Franz Kafka. The literary culture that the measures perpetuated complemented the research activities of our School of English, which today hosts some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners. We are highly distinctive in accommodating poets, dramatists and creatives including Professor Don Patterson OBE Professor John Burnside, and Professor Zinnie Harris, whose combination of creativity, ingenuity and critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since Salvatore's Chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, it is my pleasure to welcome you all, after which the confirmation of degrees by the Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will commence. This ceremony recognizes that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation, and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that poor city of quintessential festivities 2 years later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in July 2020, and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred, with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which the Chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. The Chancellor will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and he will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirm the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP to most though. The Chancellor will simply say at Super Tay, meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our veterans Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Warwick Hall. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Due to the indisposition of today's scheduled speaker, professor Sean Allen from the School of Modern Languages, I will return to deliver the graduation address. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews, and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a Saint Andrew throughout your life.

I call upon Professor Ali Ansari of the School of History. Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris Kyosei, Warwick Bull. Warwick Ball is an archaeologist of the Near East and Central Asia with a particular interest in Afghanistan. He is a teacher, writer, and explorer, a prolific author whose career is testament to the fact. That pathways to intellectual innovation and success are rarely orthodox, that to push the boundaries of the envelope, one must frequently venture to the frontiers, both geographically and intellectually of knowledge. Warwick began his career in archaeology when he went to join the excavations at Seraf in southern Iran. During his gap year at the age of 19, he never looked back. Avoiding the traditional path of a university degree, Warwick decided instead to stay in the field, extending his interest into Afghanistan. In 1972, a country for which he would discover among the many artifacts and abiding interests and affection. He served as the last effective director of the British Institute of Afghan Studies, being one of the last Western archaeologists to leave the country in 1981. It also convinced him that the approaches to the archaeology and history of the Near East lent too heavily in a Eurocentric direction. Most obviously, the conventional understanding of the Roman Empire. It is no exaggeration to say that Warwick's work brought Afghanistan in from the margins to its rightful place as a key player in the history of Eurasia. With further work in excavations in Syria, Libya, Ethiopia, Jordan and Iraq, Warrick effectively and cogently argued for a more cosmopolitan interpretation of developments. Is chewing simple explanations. Warwick sought to reflect the complex dynamics at work in the movements of peoples and ideas across Eurasia. The spread in particular religious ideas, including the fact that Buddhism spread West before it spread east and the role of women in the adoption of Christianity in Rome. His many books and publications include excavations at Kandahar, Cairo to Kabul. Ancient settlement in the Zamara region. Syria and architectural and historical guide. The monument of Afghanistan. Rome in the east. The transformation of an empire awarded the James Henry Breasted History prize. The archaeological gazeteer of Afghanistan. The archaeology of Afghanistan and the Eurasian Steppe people movement ideas. His keen interest in the question of European identity and the impact of the Easter explored in a quartet of books published between 2009 and 2015 under the rubric of Asia and Europe and the making of the West. In 1994, Warwick founded eastern approaches, a special interest heritage tour operator, taking his first tour to North Eastern Iran. His final tour in 2016 was to northern China, taking a party from Xanadu to the Jade Gate. Despite having formally retired in 2016, Warwick remains very much active in the field, founding the journal Afghanistan in 2018, and publishing east of the wardrobe. The unexpected worlds of CS Lewis. An investigation into the eastern religious elements in the writing of CS Lewis in 2022. Chancellor for his tireless efforts in expanding the horizons of our understanding of the East and its profound impact on the West. I invite you to confer after a 52 year gap year.

Installations. Well, stunning here I feel a little bit of a cheat being probably the only person in this room who's never been to university. Well, I do say probably because my granddaughter also happens to be here and she's also never been to university, but she's just one. Having taken a gap year after leaving school. It has somehow extended to 52 years, having finally been awarded a degree. I feel like now ought to go out and get a proper job, but it also makes my admiration all the more for your yourselves for achieving in just a few years what has taken me 52 years to do. It's a fantastic achievement which I more than anybody else can appreciate. Congratulations. It also makes my admiration humbly all the more to this ancient university for awarding someone who has gone against a system which this university has helped put into place. I thank the university from the bottom of my heart for this honour. But this makes any advice that I can give to new graduates all the more heartfelt, whatever lies ahead. Remember there are many ways to roam at many doors and to Narnia. You don't have to go down the well trodden Rd at all. You can be unconventional and against the grain also works. Thank you. I call upon the principle of the university. It now falls upon me to deliver today's graduation address and it is conventional to begin with a wholehearted and emphatic note of congratulations to our graduates. You have done it. In attaining your degree, you completed an intellectual journey that has demanded sustained investment across many months or years, as well as intellectual curiosity and sheer hard work. These capabilities were sharpened during your programme and you are better equipped for what comes next. Indeed, better able to envisage and create your own path. A degree from Saint Andrews is not easily gained, but it is something that you have earned and which nobody can take away from you. You and your friends, families, teachers and peers have every right to feel very proud today. You also have more to celebrate than most for the final few months of your degree programme. The pandemic ruptured the conventional delivery of teaching and demanded that you exercise greater dexterity than any of your forebears. I know it was not simple, but in coming through a time of great challenge with something of equally great value to show for it, you demonstrated a quintessentially St. Andrews spirit of Endeavour and excellence. During some of the most severe lockdowns necessitated by the pandemic, whether spent in Saint Andrews or elsewhere, reading and learning were two of the great reliefs of daily life for many of us. They were supplemented by exercise. I was in Saint Andrews throughout the pandemic years. An exercise here first took the form of our daily government, allocated 30 minute dash out of the house, which later proliferated when outdoor activities were. Increasingly enabled into much longer stretches of walking, hiking and running. A poor city of tourists and at times students and staff made Saint Andrews a quiet place for those of us who remained, but its beaches and streets were unfailingly punctuated by people running or walking their way through the anxieties of the moment. This draws upon a long tradition of exercise at Saint Andrews, in which running has been used as a way to offset the stresses of studying by generations of students. Before your enrollment here, some of your attending guests may have been more familiar with our town as either the home of golf or as the setting of the opening scene of the 1981 film Chariots of Fire. That sequence, in which a group of students run along West Sands toward Saint Andrews, is one of the most iconic cinematic visuals in Western film, and it is accompanied by an equally iconic school by the composer Vangelis, who passed away just last month. It is a scene, recreated consciously or otherwise hundreds of times every day by the students who run across the sands and with more deliberate intent at the annual Chariots of Fire 5K beach race. The latest iteration of this event took place at the beginning of this month and it brought together 700 staff students in townsfolk for a community celebration of exercise in the landscape that we are so fortunate to inhabit. Further sources of athletic inspiration are present on our stage. That makes a number of people behind me nervous, but let me explain what I'm talking about, but particularly in our honourable Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem. Lord Campbell is a polymath of renown, a lawyer by training a parliamentarian of historic significance and an incisive foreign affairs and defence. Specialist Lord Campbell serves to this day as a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly as part of the UK delegation that he led from 2020 2010. To 2015 Lord Campbell is, however, also an Olympian of equally historic proportions. He competed at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, including in the four by 100 metre relay, at which he and his team established a new British record. Lord Campbell subsequently competed in the 1966 Commonwealth Games. He later defeated OJ Simpson in a competitive 100 metre race in 1967 and from 1967 to 1974 he held he held the National 100 metre record. In his autobiography, published in 2008, Lord Campbell recalls his feelings upon leaving Tokyo as an Olympian. Writing, I worked for it, dreamed of it and finally achieved it. I remember it vividly as if it were yesterday. Like running, studying is about perseverance about getting to the library or laboratory every day and doing the work. It can often be a solitary activity and its rewards do not immediately manifest. One must simply trust that through repeated labour and constant endeavour, a transformation occurs by degrees that through time leads both to a distinct sharpening of 1's capabilities and the discovery of new understandings. Every assignment you completed, every page you read or every experiment you conducted placed you one foot further forward. And today we mark your completion of the race. Running is not an activity that everyone enjoys. Some of you will default to other sports, or the gentler pleasures of walking, but every academic can relate to the central ethos of running a will towards self improvement that is wonderfully described by the Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami. In his 2007 memoir. What I talk about when I talk about running. I'm quoting running day after day piling up the races bit by bit. I raised the bar and by clearing each level I elevate myself. The point is whether or not I'm proved over yesterday in long distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself. The way you used to be. Your time studying as part of the class of your year group is over. While you will will always be part of the rich and inclusive alumni community, the track ahead is one that you must pursue alone. Guided by your principles and impulses. That is a daunting prospect, but also a tremendously exciting one. It's time to set your own standards and aspirations. St. Andrews has equipped you with the skills, knowledge and perseverance necessary to excel in anything you wish to pursue and the future lies ahead. So run towards it for the prize is yours to take. Thank you. Well, I must thank the principal for her generous references. To me it was a long time ago, but I still remember it as if it were yesterday. Please stand for the benediction. Grazia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi, at Caritas de, at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis. And secular secularism. Ohmen"
