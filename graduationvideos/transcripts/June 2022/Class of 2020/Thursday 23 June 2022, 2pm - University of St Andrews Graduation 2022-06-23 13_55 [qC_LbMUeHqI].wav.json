nostrum amen please be seated i called upon the principle of the university good afternoon everyone it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place in saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors as is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the way in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at fifteenth century saint andrews as two distracting but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows students life in saint leonards college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started class at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden unless they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over fifty years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds saint andrews had become as described by one contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the universities scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduced the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundred student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred gathered guests garden parties were spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of a hundred and forty five universities and learned societies visited and one hundred honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes it is their foresight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since salvatore's chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor it is my pleasure to welcome you all after which the confirmation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities two years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july twenty twenty and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which the chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelor 's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony the chancellor will call upon the deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say et super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete i shall then make a special presentation of the principal 's medal an award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to two of our graduates the principal 's medal for the academic year twenty nineteen to twenty twenty will today be bestowed upon morgan brooke johnson formerly of the school of management and zoe mengiste formerly of the school of computer science saint salvatore chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion the choir will today be conducted by doctor michael downes director of music we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour doctor fiona hill i will deliver the graduation address to close our ceremony a traditional message of congratulation and inspiration to our graduates the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artis artium chancellor i asked you to confirm the degree of

principles medal this award was inaugurated thirteen years ago with a gift from three anonymous donors and is supported by ed and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and rope makers in the world the award of the principal 's medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year twenty nineteen to twenty twenty the principal 's medal was awarded to three outstanding students and this celebration enables us to bestow the medal in the customary way today we recognise morgan brooke johnson and zoe ngiti and i'm pleased to note that both morgan and zoe received first class degrees in twenty twenty i will now present the principal 's medal to morgan brooke johnson morgan joined the university of saint andrews via our supported pathway program succeeding in gaining a place initially to read for the master of arts general degree this supported pathways program is designed to unlock potential where it had previously not been allowed to flourish and during her time at saint andrews morgan has been an outstanding example of its work after completing her second year of general level study morgan advanced to honours level she subsequently made the deans list through outstanding academic achievement in both honours years and in twenty twenty she received the nisbit prize which recognises the most outstanding management student in the entire class morgan graduated in twenty twenty with one of the most accomplished student records of her cohort despite being a commuter student with significant responsibilities at home that were not shared by many of her peers morgan 's generosity and will for self advancement were demonstrated outside of the classroom in her spare time morgan volunteered as a mentor for gateway to art students in which role she has supported many incoming widening access students in transitioning to the saint andrews community and as an undergraduate morgan was approached to work as a research assistant by academics within the school of management who was so impressed by her resourcefulness that they insisted she continued into postgraduate research i'm delighted to recognise that morgan remains a student at our university where she continues to lead her cohort academically and is fast emerging as an academic leader of the future after receiving the principal 's medal morgan studied for the degree of master of research in management studies which she attained with distinction in autumn twenty twenty one again at the top of her class morgan is now in her first year reading for the degree of doctor of philosophy in our school of management with her research focusing upon the role of women in philanthropic organisations and her rigour talent and ambition show no signs of abating morgan in recognition of all that you have achieved academically and your selfless support of others it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal 's medal congratulations again to morgan i will now present the principles medal to zoe mengiste so his nomination referenced her formidable intellectual accomplishments she made the deans list for outstanding academic achievement in each year of study at the university demonstrating her sustained commitment to excellence and she graduated with one of the most distinguished academic profiles of her entire cohort in her spare time zoe engaged tirelessly with consciousness raising activities particularly in the area of racial and ethnic diversity in her capacity as the SRC member for racial diversity for the twenty nineteen to twenty twenty academic year zoe founded saint andrews multicultural week and she worked to ensure that all students were represented at the highest levels of the university so his time at saint andrews set an example for how one can excel personally while supporting others and affecting lasting cultural change the principles of inclusivity and respect which so firmly underscored zoe 's student days have continued to influence her life beyond university after graduating in twenty twenty zoe assumed a position as a forward deployed software engineer with palantir technologies based in london where she works on both public and private sector projects including in partnership with the university of texas MD anderson cancer centre on a project investigating the impact of covid on cancer patients as a continuing ambassador for widening access so he has increased the scope of palantir 's engagements with state schools and she founded the first summer boot camp for high school students to learn foundational data engineering skills zoey in recognition of all that you have achieved both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate and with great admiration for your ongoing contributions to progressive causes it gives me very great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal 's medal i call upon professor richard watmore of the school of history chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of letters honoris causa doctor fiona hill fiona hill has had a busy life since graduating in history and russian from this great university in nineteen eighty seven there are five reasons why she merits this honour firstly she has served as a peacemaker in war zone since the nineteen nineties and has helped to prevent war when possible and to restore peace when conflict occurs for such relentless and often unforgiving labours she ranks among the blessed secondly she has been an intelligence analyst under presidents george W bush and barack obama guiding their policy during times of international turbulence she was appointed by president donald trump as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for european and russian affairs on his national security council for someone originally from the UK to rise to such heights signifies rarefied levels of expertise and diplomatic competence all parties across the political spectrum have given her their trust thirdly she was a key witness in the november twenty nineteen house of representatives hearings regarding the impeachment of president trump for such an act in defence of the constitution of the united states and the health of that democracy she was praised but also widely trolled and threatened donald trump has called her a deep state stiff he added with a nice accent because of her northeast lilt she has shown singular courage fourthly she's become a notable public intellectual exercising influence through her membership of the US government 's council on foreign relations and as a senior fellow at brookings and entertaining us all with practical wisdom and good sense when talking to the likes of stephen colbert and bill maher or on desert island discs she shows what you can do with an outstanding education and that scholars can make a difference in the real world in addition she writes super books fifthly and finally she has risen from a position and a place that make her achievements all the more remarkable her father was a miner turned hospital porter and her mother a midwife as a child she lived in circumstances of love but relative poverty lacking even a TV no screens can you imagine the hell she hails from a part of the world that does not get much attention bishop auckland the only nearby place you may have heard of is barnard castle which briefly was in the news because dominic cummings checked his eyesight there before driving back to london when we were all supposed to be in lockdown bishop auckland is in county durham it is mining country suffering D industrialisation with the cloning closing of the pits when fiona was a child if you look up feigner famous people from county durham you find tony blair who was actually born in edinburgh and rowan atkinson who went to the same school as blair when a boy the same one that cummings later attended to fiona by contrast attended the local comprehensive school she is a strong woman in a world of politicians and policy dominated by men and masculine rhetoric she understands people and the ideologies that fire them the dangerous in addition to the worthy let us praise then this singular woman who does honour to saint andrews and who is an inspiration to all of us for her wisdom bravery and integrity chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to international relations politics and history i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters and norris cowser on doctor fiona hill ted grantham doctors litteram sonoras kaza promovido could this rehan symbolum super tay who berekum imponer well i just wanted to say a few words of congratulation to all of you while i try not to be garrotted by this herd did everybody else have that happen here i have to say that actually walking watching all of you walk across the stage was really inspiring first of all you showed me the way i watched very carefully about how you knelt in front of the chancellor i managed to get up again because of our capture here everybody needs a very strong pair of hands and a catch in life and i think we've all got off to a fantastic start as a result so thank you very much i did have a hard time getting up there at the end and i just again want to commend all of you on this has been a really tough period for everyone and i'm sure that at first it was extremely disappointing when you couldn't come and walk across the stage in twenty twenty i can only imagine all of the difficulties that many of you will have had in the last two years as well finishing your degrees not yet having them confirmed trying to find your way in life in the midst of a pandemic i mean i i'm sure that many of you your family suffered maybe some of you fell ill and i just want to say that you know you've got through all of this this is now the beginning of something you're already on the journey with and one of the things that really sustained me through my time at saint andrews which was also a difficult period but different from this was all of the friends that i made as well as all of my wonderful teachers and professors some of those friends are actually with me now and in fact richard whitmore though we weren't together here at saint andrews we ended up on on a scholarship together at harvard in nineteen eighty nine and i was amazed to find that richard was also from durham so we actually knew where bishop auckland was and actually just as a little bit of an aside i was really quite struck that the first song that the choir sang was by edward elgar edward elgar also knew where bishop auckland was he had a friend there that he met in college and he composed one of his symphonies in bishop auckland everybody thought how did he get there but anyway edward elgar was there too so it was very nice to hear a little bit of elgar at the very beginning i also have sitting somewhere behind meet gavin bowd who was in my first starts french and russian classes now one of your professors i'm here in french i hope some people here took talked about 's classes as well as doctor whitmores and i have sitting up in the balcony with me jennifer saville who was then jenny mcmillan when we were at saint andrews together in the year ahead of me that i met in the mermaids and jimmy is now my literary agent so just take a quick look at the people next to you you never know who they might turn out to be and when you might need them not just getting caught when you can't get up from the podium but just sometimes when you need to have a different direction in life and i'm always is ever grateful for everything that i took away from saint andrews my first graduation way back when it was a very long time ago i had my parents with me now i have my daughter and i'm hoping hampton barrister she's sitting up there in the balcony is nothing worse than embarrassing your fifteen year old daughter that will come to all of you at one point as well but there is nothing more wonderful than being graduates of saint andrews and i just want to commend you all again today congratulate you for making it through all these tough times i'm easy to find and if i can be ever of any help to any of you i stand ready as part of the larger saint andrews community that you're already part of and that you and all of your family and friends are now especially part of today congratulations to all of you i called upon the principle of the university right everybody we're going to start with just a very brief moment of audience participation this is i'm only going to ask you to do something once and then you can all all relax but we're just going to take a little poll and and this includes everybody on the stage please and parents it's not just just graduates so may i ask those of you who are familiar with the nineteen sixty seven movie to graduate that is you've seen it to raise your hands kate thank you that's it now right now i think having seen that there may be something of a generational divide here when i graduated from university towards the end of the nineteen seventies my entire generation would have been familiar with the graduate could recite parts of its screenplay and property could still do so now however a little recent local market research that is to say i asked my executive assistant who's graduate and in his twenties reinforced by the results we've just had suggests that the current graduating cohort might not have quite such familiarity with this frankly iconic film well graduates two years on from your original graduation date you will have many calls on your time but do try to make some space this summer to watch this movie if you are not familiar with it in what follows i will try not to spoil too much of the storyline but i will indicate some reasons why i think in the context of your own graduation the film still holds its value the graduate was directed by mike nichols and starred dustin hoffman and anne bancroft again those names will be familiar to some of us it is set in southern california in the los angeles area as his family prepare for a party to celebrate his recent graduation the graduate benjamin braddock is asked by his father have you thought about graduate school no benjamin replies would you mind telling me then says his father what those four years of college were for what was the point of all that hard work you got me benjamin who is often inclined to take the line of least resistance replies mister braddock senior attitude to further study might seem pretty enlightened and it is one that we would very much respect and indeed encourage here at saint andrews as you develop your career plans further study at post graduate or doctoral level has a lot to recommend it and i would add to this particular cohort that this is not something that you necessarily have to do immediately there can be some value and i speak from personal experience in taking a year or two about to do other things before you go back to further study with the assurance that that is what you really want to do that said though a popular option amongst our graduates post graduate study is only one of the many possibilities that lie ahead of you all however as the conversation between father and son develops in the graduate it becomes apparent that mister braddock senior 's view of his son 's future stems from a further set of generationally inflected attitudes as his son drifts on an inflatable raft in their pool his father trying unsuccessfully to control himself says now listen ben i think it's a very good thing that a young man after he's done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass at this point in the film 's gloriously subtle screenplay ben 's mother appears and says the robinsons are here it is possible that there are those in this audience who may share the frustrations of mister braddock senior to them i would say your children have a lifetime ahead of them taking some time to reflect regroup and assess possibilities really does have something to be said for it we are all different some graduates like to have the next stage of their lives set up for them before their graduation ceremony is over some prefer to take longer even a year or two to assess their options one size does not fit all the graduate is a film very much about rights of passage but as you can tell it is also a film about generational perspectives and this is where it can still surprise us one of the troops in the film again related to what benjamin is going to do with his life is voiced by mister mcguire a convivial and very corporate friend of benjamin 's parents during what to benjamin is an interminable drinks party to celebrate his success mister mcguire i want to say one word to you benjamin just one word benjamin yes sir mister mcguire are you listening benjamin yes i am mister mcguire plastics benjamin exactly how do you mean mister mcguire there is a great future in plastics think about it now there is actually a lot going on here mister mcguire 's belief in plastics is in the film seen as symbolic of the boring views of the affluent american middle classes to which benjamin belongs but which with a nod to the hippie era of his day benjamin is trying to reject ironically of course this leads management into an affair with another member of the middle classes the older woman mrs robinson thus prompting probably the most memorable piece of dialogue in the whole film mrs robinson do you find me undesirable benjamin ohh no mrs robinson i think you're the most attractive of all my parents friends now just to be clear i am not advocating any of the courses of action that benjamin contemplates or takes in the film as far as mrs robinson is concerned as a good idea for our new graduates the point here is that the inexperienced idealistic benjamin suspicion of the corporate plastic oriented worldview espoused by mister mcguire has been proved over time to be justified plastics have given much to our world in flexibility and facility of manufacturing they have also given it a terrible ecological legacy which successive generations will have to contend with on a global scale benjamin braddock in the graduate is young inexperienced idealistic but he is not willing to take his future for granted or to follow the paths that his parents and most of their friends believe as straightforwardly mapped out for him now as i've said i'm not going to spoil all the plot development of the film for those of you who astonishingly have not seen it but i believe it is OK to tell you that the end of the film sees benjamin committed to a particular decision we're heading for a future that suddenly looks both exciting and uncertain fifty five years after the graduate appeared it contrives in that regard to remain highly resonant and because the film is about generational tensions it is a film that you may find you orient yourself towards differently over the course of a lifetime graduates you have done superlatively well not that you need it but take this as your licence to celebrate once more to take time out but then also please powerfully consider your own futures and the planets and bear in mind that in fifty years time also you yourself will be looking back on this remarkable time in your life so please make the most of it thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christy at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular seclorum amen on",

nostrum amen please be seated i called upon the principle of the university good afternoon everyone it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929 the younger hall closed in july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place in saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors as is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the way in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of 15th century st andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until 1747 examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century st andrews as two distracting but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470 when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows students life in st leonards college over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at 5:00 AM attended mass at six started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden unless they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over 50 years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in 1742 james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in 1775 and in 1792 edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s saint andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the universities scotland act of 1858 introduced the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in 1892 and by the 1900 student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september 1911 which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties were spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june 1929 its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes it is their foresight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since salvatore's chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor it is my pleasure to welcome you all after which the confirmation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence this ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities 2 years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july 2020 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which the chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelor's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony the chancellor will call upon the deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say et super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete i shall then make a special presentation of the principal's medal an award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to two of our graduates the principal's medal for the academic year 2019 to 2020 will today be bestowed upon morgan brooke johnson formerly of the school of management and zoe mengiste formerly of the school of computer science saint salvatore chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion the choir will today be conducted by doctor michael downes director of music we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour dr fiona hill i will deliver the graduation address to close our ceremony a traditional message of congratulation and inspiration to our graduates the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artis artium chancellor i asked you to confirm the degree of master of arts with honours on mackenzie minovsky tai was gradual magistrate

congratulations to all our graduates i should now like to introduce the principles medal this award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by ed and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and rope makers in the world the award of the principal's medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year 2019 to 2020 the principal's medal was awarded to three outstanding students and this celebration enables us to bestow the medal in the customary way today we recognise morgan brooke johnson and zoe ngiti and i'm pleased to note that both morgan and zoe received first class degrees in 2020 i will now present the principal's medal to morgan brooke johnson morgan joined the university of saint andrews via our supported pathway program succeeding in gaining a place initially to read for the master of arts general degree this supported pathways program is designed to unlock potential where it had previously not been allowed to flourish and during her time at saint andrews morgan has been an outstanding example of its work after completing her second year of general level study morgan advanced to honours level she subsequently made the deans list through outstanding academic achievement in both honours years and in 2020 she received the nisbit prize which recognises the most outstanding management student in the entire class morgan graduated in 2020 with one of the most accomplished student records of her cohort despite being a commuter student with significant responsibilities at home that were not shared by many of her peers morgan's generosity and will for self advancement were demonstrated outside of the classroom in her spare time morgan volunteered as a mentor for gateway to art students in which role she has supported many incoming widening access students in transitioning to the saint andrews community and as an undergraduate morgan was approached to work as a research assistant by academics within the school of management who was so impressed by her resourcefulness that they insisted she continued into postgraduate research i'm delighted to recognise that morgan remains a student at our university where she continues to lead her cohort academically and is fast emerging as an academic leader of the future after receiving the principal's medal morgan studied for the degree of master of research in management studies which she attained with distinction in autumn 2021 again at the top of her class morgan is now in her first year reading for the degree of doctor of philosophy in our school of management with her research focusing upon the role of women in philanthropic organisations and her rigour talent and ambition show no signs of abating morgan in recognition of all that you have achieved academically and your selfless support of others it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal's medal congratulations again to morgan i will now present the principles medal to zoe mengiste so his nomination referenced her formidable intellectual accomplishments she made the deans list for outstanding academic achievement in each year of study at the university demonstrating her sustained commitment to excellence and she graduated with one of the most distinguished academic profiles of her entire cohort in her spare time zoe engaged tirelessly with consciousness raising activities particularly in the area of racial and ethnic diversity in her capacity as the SRC member for racial diversity for the 2019 to 2020 academic year zoe founded saint andrews multicultural week and she worked to ensure that all students were represented at the highest levels of the university so his time at saint andrews set an example for how one can excel personally while supporting others and affecting lasting cultural change the principles of inclusivity and respect which so firmly underscored zoe's student days have continued to influence her life beyond university after graduating in 2020 zoe assumed a position as a forward deployed software engineer with palantir technologies based in london where she works on both public and private sector projects including in partnership with the university of texas MD anderson cancer centre on a project investigating the impact of covid on cancer patients as a continuing ambassador for widening access so he has increased the scope of palantir's engagements with state schools and she founded the first summer boot camp for high school students to learn foundational data engineering skills zoey in recognition of all that you have achieved both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate and with great admiration for your ongoing contributions to progressive causes it gives me very great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal's medal i call upon professor richard watmore of the school of history chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of letters honoris causa dr fiona hill fiona hill has had a busy life since graduating in history and russian from this great university in 1987 there are five reasons why she merits this honour firstly she has served as a peacemaker in war zone since the 1990s and has helped to prevent war when possible and to restore peace when conflict occurs for such relentless and often unforgiving labours she ranks among the blessed secondly she has been an intelligence analyst under presidents george W bush and barack obama guiding their policy during times of international turbulence she was appointed by president donald trump as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for european and russian affairs on his national security council for someone originally from the UK to rise to such heights signifies rarefied levels of expertise and diplomatic competence all parties across the political spectrum have given her their trust thirdly she was a key witness in the november 2019 house of representatives hearings regarding the impeachment of president trump for such an act in defence of the constitution of the united states and the health of that democracy she was praised but also widely trolled and threatened donald trump has called her a deep state stiff he added with a nice accent because of her NE lilt she has shown singular courage fourthly she's become a notable public intellectual exercising influence through her membership of the US government's council on foreign relations and as a senior fellow at brookings and entertaining us all with practical wisdom and good sense when talking to the likes of stephen colbert and bill maher or on desert island discs she shows what you can do with an outstanding education and that scholars can make a difference in the real world in addition she writes super books fifthly and finally she has risen from a position and a place that make her achievements all the more remarkable her father was a miner turned hospital porter and her mother a midwife as a child she lived in circumstances of love but relative poverty lacking even a TV no screens can you imagine the hell she hails from a part of the world that does not get much attention bishop auckland the only nearby place you may have heard of is barnard castle which briefly was in the news because dominic cummings checked his eyesight there before driving back to london when we were all supposed to be in lockdown bishop auckland is in county durham it is mining country suffering D industrialisation with the cloning closing of the pits when fiona was a child if you look up feigner famous people from county durham you find tony blair who was actually born in edinburgh and rowan atkinson who went to the same school as blair when a boy the same one that cummings later attended to fiona by contrast attended the local comprehensive school she is a strong woman in a world of politicians and policy dominated by men and masculine rhetoric she understands people and the ideologies that fire them the dangerous in addition to the worthy let us praise then this singular woman who does honour to saint andrews and who is an inspiration to all of us for her wisdom bravery and integrity chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to international relations politics and history i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters and norris cowser on doctor fiona hill ted grantham doctors litteram sonoras kaza promovido could this rehan symbolum super tay who berekum imponer well i just wanted to say a few words of congratulation to all of you while i try not to be garrotted by this herd did everybody else have that happen here i have to say that actually walking watching all of you walk across the stage was really inspiring first of all you showed me the way i watched very carefully about how you knelt in front of the chancellor i managed to get up again because of our capture here everybody needs a very strong pair of hands and a catch in life and i think we've all got off to a fantastic start as a result so thank you very much i did have a hard time getting up there at the end and i just again want to commend all of you on this has been a really tough period for everyone and i'm sure that at first it was extremely disappointing when you couldn't come and walk across the stage in 2020 i can only imagine all of the difficulties that many of you will have had in the last two years as well finishing your degrees not yet having them confirmed trying to find your way in life in the midst of a pandemic i mean i i'm sure that many of you your family suffered maybe some of you fell ill and i just want to say that you know you've got through all of this this is now the beginning of something you're already on the journey with and one of the things that really sustained me through my time at saint andrews which was also a difficult period but different from this was all of the friends that i made as well as all of my wonderful teachers and professors some of those friends are actually with me now and in fact richard whitmore though we weren't together here at saint andrews we ended up on on a scholarship together at harvard in 1989 and i was amazed to find that richard was also from durham so we actually knew where bishop auckland was and actually just as a little bit of an aside i was really quite struck that the first song that the choir sang was by edward elgar edward elgar also knew where bishop auckland was he had a friend there that he met in college and he composed one of his symphonies in bishop auckland everybody thought how did he get there but anyway edward elgar was there too so it was very nice to hear a little bit of elgar at the very beginning i also have sitting somewhere behind meet gavin bowd who was in my first starts french and russian classes now one of your professors i'm here in french i hope some people here took talked about's classes as well as doctor whitmores and i have sitting up in the balcony with me jennifer saville who was then jenny mcmillan when we were at saint andrews together in the year ahead of me that i met in the mermaids and jimmy is now my literary agent so just take a quick look at the people next to you you never know who they might turn out to be and when you might need them not just getting caught when you can't get up from the podium but just sometimes when you need to have a different direction in life and i'm always is ever grateful for everything that i took away from saint andrews my first graduation way back when it was a very long time ago i had my parents with me now i have my daughter and i'm hoping hampton barrister she's sitting up there in the balcony is nothing worse than embarrassing your 15 year old daughter that will come to all of you at one point as well but there is nothing more wonderful than being graduates of saint andrews and i just want to commend you all again today congratulate you for making it through all these tough times i'm easy to find and if i can be ever of any help to any of you i stand ready as part of the larger saint andrews community that you're already part of and that you and all of your family and friends are now especially part of today congratulations to all of you i called upon the principle of the university right everybody we're going to start with just a very brief moment of audience participation this is i'm only going to ask you to do something once and then you can all all relax but we're just going to take a little poll and and this includes everybody on the stage please and parents it's not just just graduates so may i ask those of you who are familiar with the 1967 movie to graduate that is you've seen it to raise your hands kate thank you that's it now right now i think having seen that there may be something of a generational divide here when i graduated from university towards the end of the 1970s my entire generation would have been familiar with the graduate could recite parts of its screenplay and property could still do so now however a little recent local market research that is to say i asked my executive assistant who's graduate and in his 20s reinforced by the results we've just had suggests that the current graduating cohort might not have quite such familiarity with this frankly iconic film well graduates 2 years on from your original graduation date you will have many calls on your time but do try to make some space this summer to watch this movie if you are not familiar with it in what follows i will try not to spoil too much of the storyline but i will indicate some reasons why i think in the context of your own graduation the film still holds its value the graduate was directed by mike nichols and starred dustin hoffman and anne bancroft again those names will be familiar to some of us it is set in southern california in the los angeles area as his family prepare for a party to celebrate his recent graduation the graduate benjamin braddock is asked by his father have you thought about graduate school no benjamin replies would you mind telling me then says his father what those four years of college were for what was the point of all that hard work you got me benjamin who is often inclined to take the line of least resistance replies mr braddock senior attitude to further study might seem pretty enlightened and it is one that we would very much respect and indeed encourage here at saint andrews as you develop your career plans further study at post graduate or doctoral level has a lot to recommend it and i would add to this particular cohort that this is not something that you necessarily have to do immediately there can be some value and i speak from personal experience in taking a year or two about to do other things before you go back to further study with the assurance that that is what you really want to do that said though a popular option amongst our graduates post graduate study is only one of the many possibilities that lie ahead of you all however as the conversation between father and son develops in the graduate it becomes apparent that mr braddock senior's view of his son's future stems from a further set of generationally inflected attitudes as his son drifts on an inflatable raft in their pool his father trying unsuccessfully to control himself says now listen ben i think it's a very good thing that a young man after he's done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass at this point in the film's gloriously subtle screenplay ben's mother appears and says the robinsons are here it is possible that there are those in this audience who may share the frustrations of mr braddock senior to them i would say your children have a lifetime ahead of them taking some time to reflect regroup and assess possibilities really does have something to be said for it we are all different some graduates like to have the next stage of their lives set up for them before their graduation ceremony is over some prefer to take longer even a year or two to assess their options one size does not fit all the graduate is a film very much about rights of passage but as you can tell it is also a film about generational perspectives and this is where it can still surprise us one of the troops in the film again related to what benjamin is going to do with his life is voiced by mr mcguire a convivial and very corporate friend of benjamin's parents during what to benjamin is an interminable drinks party to celebrate his success mr mcguire i want to say one word to you benjamin just one word benjamin yes sir mr mcguire are you listening benjamin yes i am mr mcguire plastics benjamin exactly how do you mean mr mcguire there is a great future in plastics think about it now there is actually a lot going on here mr mcguire's belief in plastics is in the film seen as symbolic of the boring views of the affluent american middle classes to which benjamin belongs but which with a nod to the hippie era of his day benjamin is trying to reject ironically of course this leads management into an affair with another member of the middle classes the older woman mrs robinson thus prompting probably the most memorable piece of dialogue in the whole film mrs robinson do you find me undesirable benjamin ohh no mrs robinson i think you're the most attractive of all my parents friends now just to be clear i am not advocating any of the courses of action that benjamin contemplates or takes in the film as far as mrs robinson is concerned as a good idea for our new graduates the point here is that the inexperienced idealistic benjamin suspicion of the corporate plastic oriented worldview espoused by mr mcguire has been proved over time to be justified plastics have given much to our world in flexibility and facility of manufacturing they have also given it a terrible ecological legacy which successive generations will have to contend with on a global scale benjamin braddock in the graduate is young inexperienced idealistic but he is not willing to take his future for granted or to follow the paths that his parents and most of their friends believe as straightforwardly mapped out for him now as i've said i'm not going to spoil all the plot development of the film for those of you who astonishingly have not seen it but i believe it is OK to tell you that the end of the film sees benjamin committed to a particular decision we're heading for a future that suddenly looks both exciting and uncertain 55 years after the graduate appeared it contrives in that regard to remain highly resonant and because the film is about generational tensions it is a film that you may find you orient yourself towards differently over the course of a lifetime graduates you have done superlatively well not that you need it but take this as your licence to celebrate once more to take time out but then also please powerfully consider your own futures and the planets and bear in mind that in 50 years time also you yourself will be looking back on this remarkable time in your life so please make the most of it thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christy at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum

Amen. Please be seated. I called upon the principle of the university. Good afternoon everyone. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions, and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place in Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape. Our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. As is not, however, a story of survival but of Leadership, Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception. And our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the way in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history, but creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors, often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics. All inspired by Aristotle. Speaking in the vernacular was forbidden, and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in Latin, which remained our official institutional language until 1747. Examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones professors, and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century St. Andrews as two distracting. But archery an important skill for the defence of the realm, was promoted. This may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470, when after an unresolved argument the Dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows. Students life in St. Leonards College over a century. After our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital. Students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six. Started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one. Weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly forbidden unless they, like football, should prove too distracting, with the exception of a single laundress. And on the condition that she was over 50 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Adam Ferguson, a renowned Enlightenment philosopher, graduated in 1742. James Wilson, a founding father of the United States, studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD. Or Doctor of medicine by the university. The French revolutionary Jean Paul Marat in 1775. And in 1792. Edward Jenner, whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox, pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s, Saint Andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. A healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by way of the Universities Scotland Act of 1858 introduced the organizational structures which remain mostly intact. To this day, women were admitted to full-time study in 1892, and by the 1900 student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences. Perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of September 1911, which resemble our activities today. Planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests. Garden parties were spread across the town. Speeches were delivered. Representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees. Were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the Bell Pettigrew Museum, and the town came to life with song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in June 1929. Its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model. In honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes. It is their foresight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better. As so many have done before them. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since Salvatore's Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor. Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, it is my pleasure to welcome you all, after which the confirmation of degrees by the Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will commence. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities. 2 years later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in July 2020, and thus. The graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred, with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which the Chancellor will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at Bachelor's Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. The Chancellor will call upon the Deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and he will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirmed the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this, I place upon you this CAP. To most though, the Chancellor will simply say ET super Tay, meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, I shall then make a special presentation of the Principal's Medal, an award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to two of our graduates. The Principal's medal for the academic year 2019 to 2020 will today be bestowed upon Morgan Brooke Johnson, formerly of the School of Management and Zoe Mengiste, formerly of the School of Computer Science. Saint Salvatore Chapel Choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins, for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. The choir will today be conducted by Doctor Michael Downes, director of music. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Dr Fiona hill. I will deliver the graduation address to close our ceremony. A traditional message of congratulation and inspiration to our graduates. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments, but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

Congratulations to all our graduates. I should now like to introduce the principles medal. This award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by Ed and Ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and rope makers in the world. The award of the Principal's Medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at Saint Andrews. The awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline, and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular. For the academic year 2019 to 2020, the Principal's Medal was awarded to three outstanding students, and this celebration enables us to bestow the medal in the customary way. Today, we recognise Morgan, Brooke Johnson and Zoe Ngiti, and I'm pleased to note that both Morgan and Zoe received first class degrees in 2020. I will now present the principal's medal to Morgan Brooke Johnson. Morgan joined the University of Saint Andrews via our supported pathway program, succeeding in gaining a place initially to read for the Master of Arts General degree. This supported pathways program is designed to unlock potential where it had previously not been allowed to flourish and during her time at Saint Andrews, Morgan has been an outstanding example of its work. After completing her second year of general level study, Morgan advanced to honours level. She subsequently made the Deans list through outstanding academic achievement in both honours years and in 2020, she received the Nisbit Prize, which recognises the most outstanding management student in the entire class. Morgan graduated in 2020 with one of the most accomplished student records of her cohort. Despite being a commuter student with significant responsibilities at home that were not shared by many of her peers. Morgan's generosity and will for self advancement were demonstrated outside of the classroom. In her spare time, Morgan volunteered as a mentor for Gateway to art students, in which role she has supported many incoming widening access students in transitioning to the Saint Andrews community. And as an undergraduate, Morgan was approached to work as a research assistant by academics within the School of Management, who was so impressed by her resourcefulness that they insisted she continued into postgraduate research. I'm delighted to recognise that Morgan remains a student at our university where she continues to lead her cohort academically and is fast emerging as an academic leader of the future. After receiving the principal's medal, Morgan studied for the degree of Master of Research in Management Studies, which she attained with distinction in autumn 2021, again at the top of her class, Morgan is now in her first year reading for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in our School of Management. With her research focusing upon the role of women in philanthropic organisations and her rigour, talent, and ambition show no signs of abating. Morgan, in recognition of all that you have achieved academically and your selfless support of others, it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal's medal. Congratulations again to Morgan. I will now present the principles medal to Zoe Mengiste. So his nomination referenced her formidable intellectual accomplishments. She made the Deans list for outstanding academic achievement in each year of study at the university, demonstrating her sustained commitment to excellence. And she graduated with one of the most distinguished academic profiles of her entire cohort. In her spare time, Zoe engaged tirelessly with consciousness, raising activities, particularly in the area of racial and ethnic diversity. In her capacity as the SRC Member for racial diversity for the 2019 to 2020 academic year, Zoe founded Saint Andrews Multicultural Week and she worked to ensure that all students were represented at the highest levels of the university. So his time at Saint Andrews set an example for how one can excel personally while supporting others and affecting lasting cultural change. The principles of inclusivity and respect, which so firmly underscored Zoe's student days, have continued to influence her life beyond university. After graduating in 2020, Zoe assumed a position as a forward deployed software engineer with Palantir Technologies based in London, where she works on both public and private sector projects, including in partnership with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre on a project investigating the impact of COVID on cancer patients. As a continuing ambassador for widening access. So he has increased the scope of Palantir's engagements with state schools. And she founded the first summer boot camp for high school students to learn foundational data engineering skills. Zoey in recognition of all that you have achieved, both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate and with great admiration for your ongoing contributions to progressive causes, it gives me very great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal's medal. I call upon Professor Richard Watmore of the School of History. Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa Dr. Fiona hill. Fiona Hill has had a busy life since graduating in history and Russian from this great university in 1987. There are five reasons why she merits this honour. Firstly, she has served as a peacemaker in war zone since the 1990s and has helped to prevent war when possible, and to restore peace when conflict occurs. For such relentless and often unforgiving labours, she ranks among the blessed. Secondly, she has been an intelligence analyst under Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama. Guiding their policy during times of international turbulence. She was appointed by President Donald Trump as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for European and Russian affairs on his National Security Council. For someone originally from the UK to rise to such heights signifies rarefied levels of expertise and diplomatic competence. All parties across the political spectrum have given her their trust. Thirdly, she was a key witness in the November 2019 House of Representatives hearings regarding the impeachment of President Trump for such an act in defence of the Constitution of the United States and the health of that democracy, she was praised but also widely trolled and threatened. Donald Trump has called her a deep state stiff. He added with a nice accent because of her NE lilt. She has shown singular courage. Fourthly, she's become a notable public intellectual, exercising influence through her membership of the US Government's Council on Foreign Relations and as a senior fellow at Brookings and entertaining us all with practical wisdom and good sense when talking to the likes of Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher or on Desert Island Discs. She shows what you can do with an outstanding education and that scholars can make a difference in the real world. In addition, she writes super books. Fifthly and finally, she has risen from a position and a place that make her achievements all the more remarkable. Her father was a miner turned hospital Porter and her mother a midwife as a child. She lived in circumstances of love, but relative poverty, lacking even a TV. No screens. Can you imagine the hell? She hails from a part of the world that does not get much attention. Bishop Auckland. The only nearby place you may have heard of is Barnard Castle, which briefly was in the news because. Dominic Cummings checked his eyesight there. Before driving back to London when we were all supposed to be in lockdown. Bishop Auckland is in County Durham. It is mining country suffering. D industrialisation with the cloning closing of the pits when Fiona was a child if you look up feigner famous people from County Durham you find Tony Blair who was actually born in Edinburgh. And Rowan Atkinson, who went to the same school as Blair when a boy, the same one that Cummings later attended to. Fiona, by contrast, attended the local comprehensive school. She is a strong woman in a world of politicians and policy dominated by men and masculine rhetoric. She understands people and the ideologies that fire them. The dangerous. In addition to the worthy. Let us praise, then this singular woman, who does honour to Saint Andrews, and who is an inspiration to all of us, for her wisdom, bravery and integrity. Chancellor, in recognition of her major contribution to international relations, politics and history. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters and Norris, Cowser on Doctor Fiona Hill. Ted Grantham doctors Litteram Sonoras kaza promovido. Could this Rehan symbolum Super Tay, who Berekum imponer? Well, I just wanted to say a few words of congratulation to all of you while I try not to be garrotted by this herd. Did everybody else have that happen here? I have to say that actually walking watching all of you walk across the stage was really inspiring. First of all, you showed me the way I watched. Very carefully about how you knelt in front of the chancellor. I managed to get up again because of our capture here. Everybody needs a very strong pair of hands and a catch in life and I think we've all got off to a fantastic start as a result. So thank you very much. I did have a hard time getting up there at the end and I just again want to commend all of you on. This has been a really tough. For everyone. And I'm sure that at first it was extremely disappointing when you couldn't come and walk across the stage in 2020. I can only imagine. All of the difficulties that many of you will have had in the last two years as well. Finishing your degrees not yet having them confirmed. Trying to find your way in life in the midst of a pandemic. I mean, I, I'm sure that many of you your family suffered maybe some of you fell ill and I just want to say that you know you've got through all of this. This is now the beginning of something you're already on the journey with. And one of the things that really sustained me through my time at Saint Andrews, which was also a difficult. But different from this. Was all of the friends that I made as well as all of my wonderful teachers and professors. Some of those friends are actually with me now, and in fact, Richard Whitmore. Though we weren't together here at Saint Andrews, we ended up on on a scholarship together at Harvard in 1989 and I was amazed to find that Richard was also from Durham. So we actually knew where Bishop Auckland was. And actually, just as a little bit of an aside, I was really quite struck that the first song that the choir sang was by Edward Elgar. Edward Elgar also knew where Bishop Auckland was. He had a friend there that he met in college and he composed one of his symphonies in Bishop Auckland. Everybody thought how did he get there, but anyway, Edward Elgar was there too. So it was very nice to hear a little bit of Elgar at the very beginning. I also have sitting somewhere behind meet Gavin Bowd, who was in my first starts French and Russian classes. Now one of your professors. I'm here in French. I hope some people here took. Talked about's classes as well as Doctor Whitmores. And I have sitting up in the balcony with me. Jennifer Saville, who was then Jenny McMillan when we were at Saint Andrews together in the year ahead of me that I met in the mermaids. And Jimmy is now my literary agent, so just take a quick look at the people next to you. You never know who they might turn out to be. And when you might need them, not just getting caught when you can't get up from the podium, but just sometimes when you need to have a different direction in life. And I'm always, is ever grateful for everything that I took away from Saint Andrews, my first graduation way back when it was a very long time ago. I had my parents with me. Now I have my daughter. And I'm hoping Hampton barrister. She's sitting up there in the balcony is nothing worse than embarrassing your 15 year old daughter that will come to all of you at one point as well. But there is nothing more wonderful than being graduates of Saint Andrews and I just want to commend you all again today. Congratulate you for making it through all these tough times. I'm easy to find and if I can be ever of any help to any of you, I stand ready as part of the larger Saint Andrews community that you're already part of and that you and all of your family and friends are now especially part of today. Congratulations to all of you. I called upon the principle of the university. Right everybody we're going to start with just a very brief moment of audience participation. This is I'm only going to ask you to do something once and then you can all all relax. But we're just going to take a little poll and and this includes everybody on the stage, please. And parents. It's not just just graduates, so may I ask those of you who are familiar with the 1967 movie? To graduate, that is, you've seen it to raise your hands. Kate, thank you, that's it. Now right now, I think having seen that, there may be something of a generational divide here. When I graduated from university towards the end of the 1970s, my entire generation would have been familiar with the graduate, could recite parts of its screenplay and property could still do so. Now, however, a little recent local market research, that is to say I asked my executive assistant who's graduate and in his 20s reinforced by the results we've just had, suggests that the current graduating cohort might not have quite such. Familiarity with this frankly iconic film. Well graduates 2 years on from your original graduation date. You will have many calls on your time, but do try to make some space this summer to watch this movie. If you are not familiar with it. In what follows I will try not to spoil too much of the storyline, but I will indicate some reasons why I think in the context of your own graduation, the film still holds its value. The graduate was directed by Mike Nichols and starred Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. Again, those names will be familiar to some of us. It is set in Southern California in the Los Angeles area as his family prepare for a party to celebrate his recent graduation. The graduate Benjamin Braddock is asked by his father. Have you thought about Graduate School? No. Benjamin replies. Would you mind telling me then says his father, what those four years of college were for? What was the point of all that hard work? You got me, Benjamin, who is often inclined to take the line of least resistance replies. Mr Braddock senior attitude to further study might seem pretty enlightened and it is one that we would very much respect and indeed encourage here at Saint Andrews as you develop your career plans. Further study at post, graduate or doctoral level has a lot to recommend it and I would add to this particular cohort that this is not something that you necessarily have to do immediately. There can be some value and I speak from personal experience in taking a year or two. About to do other things before you go back to further study with the assurance that that is what you really want to do. That said, though, a popular option amongst our graduates post graduate study is only one of the many possibilities that lie ahead of you all. However, as the conversation between Father and son develops in the graduate, it becomes apparent that Mr. Braddock Senior's view of his son's future stems from a further set of generationally inflected attitudes. As his son drifts on an inflatable raft in their pool, his father, trying unsuccessfully to control himself, says. Now listen, Ben, I think it's a very good thing that a young man, after he's done some very good work, should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks, I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass. At this point, in the film's gloriously subtle screenplay, Ben's mother appears and says, the Robinsons are here. It is possible that there are those in this audience who may share the frustrations of Mr Braddock senior to them, I would say your children have a lifetime ahead of them taking some time to reflect, regroup and assess possibilities. Really does have something to be said for it. We are all different. Some graduates like to have the next stage of their lives set up for them before their graduation ceremony is over. Some prefer to take longer, even a year or two to assess their options. One size does not fit all. The graduate is a film very much about rights of passage, but as you can tell, it is also a film about generational perspectives, and this is where it can still surprise us. One of the troops in the film again related to what Benjamin is going to do with his life, is voiced by Mr McGuire. A convivial and very corporate friend of Benjamin's parents, during what to Benjamin is an interminable drinks party to celebrate his success. Mr McGuire, I want to say one word to you, Benjamin. Just one word. Benjamin, yes Sir. Mr McGuire, are you listening Benjamin? Yes I am Mr McGuire plastics. Benjamin, exactly how do you mean Mr. McGuire? There is a great future in plastics. Think about it now. There is actually a lot going on here. Mr Mcguire's belief in plastics is in the film seen as symbolic of the boring views of the affluent American middle classes, to which Benjamin belongs, but which, with a nod to the hippie era of his day, Benjamin is trying to reject. Ironically, of course, this leads management into an affair with another member of the middle classes. The older woman, Mrs. Robinson, thus prompting probably the most memorable piece of dialogue in the whole film. Mrs. Robinson, do you find me undesirable, Benjamin? Ohh no Mrs. Robinson, I think you're the most attractive of all my parents friends. Now, just to be clear, I am not advocating any of the courses of action that Benjamin contemplates or takes in the film. As far as Mrs. Robinson is concerned, as a good idea for our new graduates. The point here is that the inexperienced idealistic Benjamin suspicion of the corporate plastic oriented worldview espoused by Mr McGuire has been proved over time to be justified, plastics have given much to our world in flexibility and facility of manufacturing. They have also given it a terrible ecological legacy which successive generations will have to contend with on a global scale. Benjamin Braddock, in the graduate, is young, inexperienced, idealistic. But he is not willing to take his future for granted or to follow the paths that his parents and most of their friends believe as straightforwardly mapped out for him. Now as I've said, I'm not going to spoil all the plot development of the film. For those of you who astonishingly have not seen it, but I believe it is OK to tell you that the end of the film sees Benjamin committed to a particular decision. We're heading for a future that suddenly looks both exciting and uncertain. 55 years after the graduate appeared, it contrives in that regard to remain highly resonant, and because the film is about generational tensions, it is a film that you may find you Orient yourself towards differently over the course of a lifetime graduates you have done superlatively well, not that you need it, but take this as your licence to celebrate once more to take time out, but then also please powerfully consider. Your own futures and the planets and bear in mind that in 50 years time also you yourself will be looking back on this remarkable time in your life, so please make the most of it. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christy at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular seclorum, Amen. On"
