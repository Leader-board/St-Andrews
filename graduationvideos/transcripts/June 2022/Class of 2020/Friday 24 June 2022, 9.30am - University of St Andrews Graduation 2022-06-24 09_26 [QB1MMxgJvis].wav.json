dominum nostrum amen please be seated good morning everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are celebrated and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremony since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learnt primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones ones professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at fifteenth century saint andrews as to distracting but archery and important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows student life in saint leonards college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidenced more of the asceticism of a university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started class at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now were it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and that on the condition that she was over fifty years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds saint andrews had become as described by one contemporary alumnus a healthy retired place in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by where the university scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduced the organizational structures which were remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundreds student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred guests garden parties spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of the hundred and forty five universities and learned societies visited and one hundred honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of a building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors it is their foresight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to address that pacity of quintessential festivities two years later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in july twenty twenty and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say get super take meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this particular academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our theaters chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innis hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is the vice principal for research and innovation professor tom brown the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your

god bravo i call upon the vice principle research and innovation professor tom brown fox chancellor colleagues special guests and graduates firstly i'd like to offer you my sincerest congratulations i cannot tell you what a pleasure it is to see all of you from the class of twenty twenty sitting in front of me today many of you will have been spoken to sit here two years ago with your friends families and supporters alongside i'm sure that for some of you this may be a bittersweet day as those who you thought would share it with you are no longer here whether through the effects of covid or otherwise i'm also sure that all of us here are immensely proud of you and what you achieved in saint andrews and your continued success since leaving the university in that most unexpected and disrupted way in march twenty twenty i hope that you've enjoyed having the excuse to return to saint andrews and that many happy memories have been rekindled with your arrival back in the last few days for my own part i still remember vividly the day i arrived more than twenty three years ago it was one of those it was on one of those winter clear cold days when you can see for miles there was snow in the mountains and the waves were crashing on the beach for many of our students the beach is one of the focal points for life in saint andrews it may be a morning jog up and down it a beach barbecue with friends or a spot of surfing in the north sea honestly how could you or even for other activities that i could not possibly comment upon the beach and the sea are strongly interwoven with the university 's history and custom i'm sure that many of you here will have taken part in the may dip there is nothing like entering the sea in various levels of clothing at door nor mayday to make you realise the benefits of even a poorly heated student house incidentally the university website tells me the main dip is meant to promote good luck in exams personally speaking i think it's more likely to promote hypothermia and is a good example of why you should not always believe everything you read on the internet i've also spent many of my years in saint andrews working as a member of the coast guard rescue service and looking around the younger hall today just checking i can't see anyone i've had to rescue which is probably a good thing in many ways the beach is a good metaphor for how life goes there are high tides and low tides occasional storm driven waves crashing to overwhelm us most importantly there's always something interesting and unexpected in every rock pool that is explored many others have had similar thoughts as well and as this is a mixed group of graduates from both arts and sciences i tried to find a figure who covered both areas of expertise the best i could come up with and you have to remember here that i am a physicist is sir isaac newton who in addition to his several words in maths and science was also a renowned bible scholar and economist in his time equally he was famous for his experimental work which included poking a wooden needle into his own eye and staring at the sun so long he temporarily blinded himself which goes to show that a deep seating wide ranging intellect and common sense are not always easy companions and a quote attributed to newton he says i do not know what i may appear to the world but to myself i seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth lay undiscovered before me my great hope is that your time by the beach in saint andrews was not wasted and that we the university have provided you with at least some of the basic strokes or maybe the inflatable arm bands that you need to start swimming in that great ocean of truth in your futures graduates i'm also well aware that i'm one of the few things standing between you and a well deserved celebration so i would like to close by wishing you all well in the futures that you are already building remember that those magnificent beaches will always be here whenever you come back to visit and please do for you were are and will always be part of this university please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sid kumon unibus nobis and secular

pleasure it is to see all of you from the class of 2020 sitting in front of me today many of you will have been spoken to sit here two years ago with your friends families and supporters alongside i'm sure that for some of you this may be a bittersweet day as those who you thought would share it with you are no longer here whether through the effects of covid or otherwise i'm also sure that all of us here are immensely proud of you and what you achieved in saint andrews and your continued success since leaving the university in that most unexpected and disrupted way in march 2020 i hope that you've enjoyed having the excuse to return to saint andrews and that many happy memories have been rekindled with your arrival back in the last few days for my own part i still remember vividly the day i arrived more than 23 years ago it was one of those it was on one of those winter clear cold days when you can see for miles there was snow in the mountains and the waves were crashing on the beach for many of our students the beach is one of the focal points for life in saint andrews it may be a morning jog up and down it a beach barbecue with friends or a spot of surfing in the north sea honestly how could you or even for other activities that i could not possibly comment upon the beach and the sea are strongly interwoven with the university's history and custom i'm sure that many of you here will have taken part in the may dip there is nothing like entering the sea in various levels of clothing at door nor mayday to make you realise the benefits of even a poorly heated student house incidentally the university website tells me the main dip is meant to promote good luck in exams personally speaking i think it's more likely to promote hypothermia and is a good example of why you should not always believe everything you read on the internet i've also spent many of my years in saint andrews working as a member of the coast guard rescue service and looking around the younger hall today just checking i can't see anyone i've had to rescue which is probably a good thing in many ways the beach is a good metaphor for how life goes there are high tides and low tides occasional storm driven waves crashing to overwhelm us most importantly there's always something interesting and unexpected in every rock pool that is explored many others have had similar thoughts as well and as this is a mixed group of graduates from both arts and sciences i tried to find a figure who covered both areas of expertise the best i could come up with and you have to remember here that i am a physicist is sir isaac newton who in addition to his several words in maths and science was also a renowned bible scholar and economist in his time equally he was famous for his experimental work which included poking a wooden needle into his own eye and staring at the sun so long he temporarily blinded himself which goes to show that a deep seating wide ranging intellect and common sense are not always easy companions and a quote attributed to newton he says i do not know what i may appear to the world but to myself i seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth lay undiscovered before me my great hope is that your time by the beach in saint andrews was not wasted and that we the university have provided you with at least some of the basic strokes or maybe the inflatable arm bands that you need to start swimming in that great ocean of truth in your futures graduates i'm also well aware that i'm one of the few things standing between you and a well deserved celebration so i would like to close by wishing you all well in the futures that you are already building remember that those magnificent beaches will always be here whenever you come back to visit and please do for you were are and will always be part of this university

Misery Cordia 2 Avita Myrnam consequent periosteum christum dominum nostrum Amen. Please be seated. Good morning everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are celebrated. And people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic, it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones. In the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremony. Since it opened in 1929, the younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed. But are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have, for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years. Students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled. The pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history, but creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learnt primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors, often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics all inspired by Aristotle. Speaking in the vernacular was forbidden, and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in Latin, which remained our official institutional language until 1747 examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones, ones, professors, and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century St. Andrews as to distracting, but archery and important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted. This may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470, when after an unresolved argument the Dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows. Student life in St. Leonards College. Over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of a university founded within a religious capital, students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six. Started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now were it will surprise no one. Weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly forbidden, lest they, like football, should prove too distracting, with the exception of a single laundress. And that on the condition that she was over. 50 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Adam Ferguson, a renowned Enlightenment philosopher, graduated in 1742. James Wilson, a founding father of the United States, studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD. Or Doctor of medicine by the university. The French revolutionary Jean Paul Marat in 1775. And in 1792. Edward Jenner, whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox, pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s, Saint Andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. A healthy retired place in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by where the University Scotland Act of 1858 introduced the organizational structures which were remain mostly intact to this day, women were admitted to full time study in 1892, and by the 1900s student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences. Perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of September 1911, which resemble our activities today. Planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 guests. Garden parties spread across the town. Speeches were delivered. Representatives of the 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed. A student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the Bell Pettigrew Museum, and the town came to life with song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in June 1929. Its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of a building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors. It is their foresight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better. As so many have done before them. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and I am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2020 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to address that pacity of quintessential festivities. 2 years later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in July 2020. And thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I will use to confirm the degrees, will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties, and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirm the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP to most, though I will simply say. Get super take meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This particular academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our theaters Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innis Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is the vice principal for research and Innovation, professor Tom Brown. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews, and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

Firstly, I'd like to offer you my sincerest congratulations. I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is to see all of you from the class of 2020 sitting in front of me today. Many of you will have been spoken to sit here two years ago with your friends, families and supporters alongside. I'm sure that for some of you, this may be a bittersweet day, as those who you thought would share it with you are no longer here. Whether through the effects of COVID or otherwise. I'm also sure that all of us here are immensely proud of you and what you achieved in Saint Andrews and your continued success since leaving the university in that most unexpected and disrupted way in March 2020. I hope that you've enjoyed having the excuse to return to Saint Andrews and that many happy memories have been rekindled with your arrival back in the last few days. For my own part, I still remember vividly the day I arrived more than 23 years ago. It was one of those. It was on one of those winter clear cold days. When you can see for miles there was snow in the mountains and the waves were crashing on the beach. For many of our students, the beach is one of the focal points for life in Saint Andrews. It may be a morning jog up and down it a beach barbecue with friends or a spot of surfing in the North Sea. Honestly, how could you? Or even for other activities that I could not possibly comment upon. The beach and the sea are strongly interwoven with the university's history and custom. I'm sure that many of you here will have taken part in the May dip. There is nothing like entering the sea in various levels of clothing at door nor Mayday, to make you realise the benefits of even a poorly heated student house. Incidentally, the university website tells me the main dip is meant to promote good luck in exams. Personally speaking, I think it's more likely to promote hypothermia and is a good example of why you should not always believe everything you read on the Internet. I've also spent many of my years in Saint Andrews working as a member of the Coast Guard Rescue Service and looking around the younger hall today. Just checking. I can't see anyone I've had to rescue, which is probably a good thing. In many ways, the beach is a good metaphor for how life goes. There are high tides and low tides, occasional storm driven waves crashing to overwhelm us. Most importantly, there's always something interesting and unexpected in every rock pool that is explored. Many others have had similar thoughts as well, and as this is a mixed group of graduates from both Arts and Sciences, I tried to find a figure who covered both areas of expertise. The best I could come up with and you have to remember here that I am a physicist is Sir Isaac Newton, who in addition to his several words in maths and science was also a renowned Bible scholar and economist in his time. Equally he was famous for his experimental work, which included poking a wooden needle into his own eye and staring at the sun. So long he temporarily blinded himself, which goes to show that a deep seating, wide ranging intellect and common sense are not always easy companions. And a quote attributed to Newton, he says. I do not know what I may appear to the world. But to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore. And diverting myself in now and then. Finding a smoother Pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay undiscovered before me. My great hope is that your time by the beach in Saint Andrews was not wasted. And that we, the university, have provided you with at least some of the basic strokes. Or maybe the inflatable arm bands that you need to start swimming in that great ocean of truth in your futures. Graduates, I'm also well aware that I'm one of the few things standing between you and a well deserved celebration, so I would like to close by wishing you all well in the futures that you are already building. Remember that those magnificent beaches will always be here whenever you come back to visit. And please do for you were are and will always be part of this university. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti. Sid Kumon, Unibus nobis and secular Siculum Ahmed."
