nostrum amen please be seated good afternoon everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decoration have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observed today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduand 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at fifteenth century saint andrews as two distracting but archery and important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows student life in saint leonards college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidenced more of the asceticism of a university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started class at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now were it will be no surprise weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over fifty years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD 's or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds saint andrews had become as described by one contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduced the organizational structures which will remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundreds student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is the university 's quincentenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred gathered guests garden parties spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of a hundred and forty five universities and learned societies visited and a hundred honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honor of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes it is their foresight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's celebrations and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i'm invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduations into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete since our theaters chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins with the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor dame francis kerwin to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is doctor sammy michael from the school of earth and environmental sciences the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so whilst you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus spackled artist arzum vice chancellor i have the honor to present for the degree of master of arts

kenneth falconer of the school of mathematics and statistics vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science on oris kausa professor dame francis kerwin a pure mathematician francis took her doctorate at oxford university working on algebraic and symplectic geometry at a time of spectacular advances in a research group that included many world leaders after short periods of research at harvard and in paris she returned to oxford where she has remained ever since she became a professor in nineteen ninety six and in two thousand and seventeen was elected civilian professor of geometry following in the steps of edmund halley and james sylvester and she was the first woman to hold this position algebraic geometry is a central area of mathematics concerning geometric objects that can be specified in terms of quadratic cubic or other polynomial equations these vary from circles and ellipses to far more complicated curves or surfaces that live in higher dimensional spaces curves of particular types may be classified by what are known as moduli spaces for example to describe a circle drawn on a piece of paper or a computer screen if you only care about its size and not its position then it is specified by a single positive number its radius similarly an ellipse may be represented by a point in a segment of the plane its coordinates corresponding to the lengths of the long and short axes moving a point around this modular space corresponds to continuously deforming the ellipses for more complicated geometric objects the moduli space has become highly convoluted twisting and doubling back on themselves in a complex manner francis 's research provides descriptions of and insights into the moduli spaces for many classes of curves and surfaces in a way that reflects both their complexity and their mathematical elegance francis says research has been recognised by numerous awards including last year by the royal society sylvester medal but she has also given varied and outstanding service to the mathematical and scientific communities she was only the second female president of the london mathematical society in its one hundred and fifty year history as a council member at the time i recall her unstinting efforts to raise the profile of mathematics in government and in the research councils she is energetic and communicating mathematics at all levels she has written several influential graduate texts but she was also chair of the UK mathematics trust which works to inspire a love of mathematics in school students she has been particularly active in addressing the gender imbalance in mathematics and supporting women in combining mathematical careers with bringing up families including as convener of european women in mathematics vice chancellor in recognition of her outstanding mathematical research and her service to mathematics i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science on our descalza on professor dame francis kerwan tea edgarton doctoris scientia honoris causa promovido curious ray in symbolum superette hoke berekum imponer and congratulations so i've been invited to say just a very few words i'm going to be very brief i'm of course deeply grateful for this honour from scotland 's oldest university in particular because my mother spent much of her childhood in scotland my grandmother was a mackay and so this beautiful country has always been very important to me so what i really want to say is to add my congratulations to all of you who have just completed your degrees a really great achievement and particularly after such a difficult couple of years so very very well done so as far as sort of advice for the future is concerned well you're going to to get some some from sammy in a minute but i did want to say so i'm a great fan of the australian songwriter and comedian tim minchin and rather than listening to any advice from me i recommend at some point listening to tim minchin 's nine life lessons which you can find on on youtube it's just five minutes of wise and funny advice he gave to graduating students when he was being given an honorary degree at his alma mater the university of western australia so you can you can listen to to his life lessons yourselves but here are some of them so one thing he said was define yourself by what you love not by what you dislike respect people with less power than you and one thing that he he said twice over so don't don't rush into worrying about what you're going to do next so you don't have to have a dream if you have a dream great go for it and with luck achieve it but you really don't have to know yet what you're going to do with the rest of your lives so enjoy today and many congratulations again i call upon doctor sammy michael of the school of earth and environmental sciences OK so kind to have water here vice chancellor 's honored guests and the graduates of the class of twenty twenty two hello it's i didn't write this bit it's so nice to see you all here in person and i've just got a sea of beaming smiles in front of me right now which is either happy that you graduated or because i'm the only thing blocking you from the garden party not sure which but probably a better both so i have some profound advice to deliver so we're powerless to stem the passing of time we move forward with the promise of tomorrow and we live in the present today now let's bask in the glow of your glory you've done well university life will shape you forever and this has been the case for every university in every country in every year since the earlier senses of learning churned out scholars in the case of this cohort we all experience something unprecedented during your time and i'm referring of course to studying and doing research during a global pandemic past few years have been some of the most difficult in my life and from what i've seen and heard from students in our school some of the most challenging for a significant number if not all of you now successfully completing a degree at saint andrews 's respected globally valued celebrated but doing so during the covid nineteen pandemic is an achievement we shouldn't understate nor overlook and this provides you all with an advantage moving forward so endurance determination adaptability these are words that could be keywords that apply to you all one or all of them don't forget that hold that to yourself and remind yourself the next time you face a bump or a problem on the horizon what you've been through and that you are sitting here today graduating also remember and i'm sure you're aware that none of you and none of us succeed alone and friends and family are the most precious commodity in existence and you shouldn't take either for granted and acknowledge though that the bonds which connect us up to the ones we love require effort from all parties to maintain their strength and so if you haven't heard from someone you love or just like a lot and they haven't text you in six months text them doesn't have to be profound just dig around for a little meme that you know made them laugh back in uni send it to them and they'll sit there and feel a warm hug coming through the phone because we found during this time period that technology is on our side really there's a the positive side too the world wide web smartphones we can stay in touch despite the best efforts of distance and time zones which would otherwise just drive us apart so i advise you all to stay connected to one another as you venture across this planet on your journey to wherever to to to whatever with whoever has your new and status as graduates my dad who's egyptian always told me when i was young a degree is even better than a passport and a degree from a top university in the UK the whole world is yours that is one of the few things he said that's absolutely true so now you've all graduated with a range of degrees today i've heard a lot of degrees mentioned we have MAFM lip BSC MSC PHD so what's next well i'm gonna hit you with a fact the path to success is nonlinear now this means that it doesn't progress or develop in a straight line from one place to the next in any logical or predictable order actually and in addition to that the definition of success is deeply personal there is no definition of success we all desire different things in and from our lives we are all unique we are all weird we are all distinct over the coming years you're all going to have to make some big life changing decisions such as which jobs you apply for which of those jobs that you're offered you accept and something that might not have crossed your mind yet is sometimes when you get offered a job you decline it you don't have to take the job where you're gonna live and with whom you will share your life so bear in mind that this morning yesterday morning and forevermore as long as you're alive you're the only person who wakes up and has the task of living your life so when you think of it this way why would you let someone else write the script on the story of your life i advise you to identify and seek out what it is you desire from your life and get your priorities straight prioritize your guilty and innocent pleasures prioritize your love and prioritize your smile wherever it may be go for it remember that you all have it in you to prevail with whatever the storm of life throws at you and this has just been proven i can say this because we're all here gowned and proud in younger hall congratulations to you all please stand for the benediction gratia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas day at communicatio spiritual sanctity sitkum omnibus nobis in secular siculum

golf were both banned at 15th century st andrews as two distracting but archery and important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470 when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows student life in st leonards college over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of a university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at 5:00 AM attended mass at six started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now were it will be no surprise weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over 50 years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in 1742 james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD's or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in 1775 and in 1792 edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s saint andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of 1858 introduced the organizational structures which will remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full time study in 1892 and by the 1900s student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is the university's quincentenary celebrations of september 1911 which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june 1929 its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honor of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes it is their foresight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's celebrations and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i'm invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduations into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete since our theaters chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins with the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor dame francis kerwin to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is doctor sammy michael from the school of earth and environmental sciences the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so whilst you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life decanus spackled artist arzum vice chancellor i have the honor to present for the degree of master of arts with honours clara cavern anska stay at brandon

on oris kausa professor dame francis kerwin a pure mathematician francis took her doctorate at oxford university working on algebraic and symplectic geometry at a time of spectacular advances in a research group that included many world leaders after short periods of research at harvard and in paris she returned to oxford where she has remained ever since she became a professor in 1996 and in 2017 was elected civilian professor of geometry following in the steps of edmund halley and james sylvester and she was the first woman to hold this position algebraic geometry is a central area of mathematics concerning geometric objects that can be specified in terms of quadratic cubic or other polynomial equations these vary from circles and ellipses to far more complicated curves or surfaces that live in higher dimensional spaces curves of particular types may be classified by what are known as moduli spaces for example to describe a circle drawn on a piece of paper or a computer screen if you only care about its size and not its position then it is specified by a single positive number its radius similarly an ellipse may be represented by a point in a segment of the plane its coordinates corresponding to the lengths of the long and short axes moving a point around this modular space corresponds to continuously deforming the ellipses for more complicated geometric objects the moduli space has become highly convoluted twisting and doubling back on themselves in a complex manner francis's research provides descriptions of and insights into the moduli spaces for many classes of curves and surfaces in a way that reflects both their complexity and their mathematical elegance francis says research has been recognised by numerous awards including last year by the royal society sylvester medal but she has also given varied and outstanding service to the mathematical and scientific communities she was only the second female president of the london mathematical society in its 150 year history as a council member at the time i recall her unstinting efforts to raise the profile of mathematics in government and in the research councils she is energetic and communicating mathematics at all levels she has written several influential graduate texts but she was also chair of the UK mathematics trust which works to inspire a love of mathematics in school students she has been particularly active in addressing the gender imbalance in mathematics and supporting women in combining mathematical careers with bringing up families including as convener of european women in mathematics vice chancellor in recognition of her outstanding mathematical research and her service to mathematics i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science on our descalza on professor dame francis kerwan tea edgarton doctoris scientia honoris causa promovido curious ray in symbolum superette hoke berekum imponer and congratulations so i've been invited to say just a very few words i'm going to be very brief i'm of course deeply grateful for this honour from scotland's oldest university in particular because my mother spent much of her childhood in scotland my grandmother was a mackay and so this beautiful country has always been very important to me so what i really want to say is to add my congratulations to all of you who have just completed your degrees a really great achievement and particularly after such a difficult couple of years so very very well done so as far as sort of advice for the future is concerned well you're going to to get some some from sammy in a minute but i did want to say so i'm a great fan of the australian songwriter and comedian tim minchin and rather than listening to any advice from me i recommend at some point listening to tim minchin's nine life lessons which you can find on on youtube it's just five minutes of wise and funny advice he gave to graduating students when he was being given an honorary degree at his alma mater the university of WA so you can you can listen to to his life lessons yourselves but here are some of them so one thing he said was define yourself by what you love not by what you dislike respect people with less power than you and one thing that he he said twice over so don't don't rush into worrying about what you're going to do next so you don't have to have a dream if you have a dream great go for it and with luck achieve it but you really don't have to know yet what you're going to do with the rest of your lives so enjoy today and many congratulations again i call upon doctor sammy michael of the school of earth and environmental sciences OK so kind to have water here vice chancellor's honored guests and the graduates of the class of 2022 hello it's i didn't write this bit it's so nice to see you all here in person and i've just got a sea of beaming smiles in front of me right now which is either happy that you graduated or because i'm the only thing blocking you from the garden party not sure which but probably a better both so i have some profound advice to deliver so we're powerless to stem the passing of time we move forward with the promise of tomorrow and we live in the present today now let's bask in the glow of your glory you've done well university life will shape you forever and this has been the case for every university in every country in every year since the earlier senses of learning churned out scholars in the case of this cohort we all experience something unprecedented during your time and i'm referring of course to studying and doing research during a global pandemic past few years have been some of the most difficult in my life and from what i've seen and heard from students in our school some of the most challenging for a significant number if not all of you now successfully completing a degree at saint andrews's respected globally valued celebrated but doing so during the COVID-19 pandemic is an achievement we shouldn't understate nor overlook and this provides you all with an advantage moving forward so endurance determination adaptability these are words that could be keywords that apply to you all one or all of them don't forget that hold that to yourself and remind yourself the next time you face a bump or a problem on the horizon what you've been through and that you are sitting here today graduating also remember and i'm sure you're aware that none of you and none of us succeed alone and friends and family are the most precious commodity in existence and you shouldn't take either for granted and acknowledge though that the bonds which connect us up to the ones we love require effort from all parties to maintain their strength and so if you haven't heard from someone you love or just like a lot and they haven't text you in six months text them doesn't have to be profound just dig around for a little meme that you know made them laugh back in uni send it to them and they'll sit there and feel a warm hug coming through the phone because we found during this time period that technology is on our side really there's a the positive side too the world wide web smartphones we can stay in touch despite the best efforts of distance and time zones which would otherwise just drive us apart so i advise you all to stay connected to one another as you venture across this planet on your journey to wherever to to to whatever with whoever has your new and status as graduates my dad who's egyptian always told me when i was young a degree is even better than a passport and a degree from a top university in the UK the whole world is yours that is one of the few things he said that's absolutely true so now you've all graduated with a range of degrees today i've heard a lot of degrees mentioned we have MAFM lip BSC MSC PHD so what's next well i'm gonna hit you with a fact the path to success is nonlinear now this means that it doesn't progress or develop in a straight line from one place to the next in any logical or predictable order actually and in addition to that the definition of success is deeply personal there is no definition of success we all desire different things in and from our lives we are all unique we are all weird we are all distinct over the coming years you're all going to have to make some big life changing decisions such as which jobs you apply for which of those jobs that you're offered you accept and something that might not have crossed your mind yet is sometimes when you get offered a job you decline it you don't have to take the job where you're gonna live and with whom you will share your life so bear in mind that this morning yesterday morning and forevermore as long as you're alive you're the only person who wakes up and has the task of living your life so when you think of it this way why would you let someone else write the script on the story of your life i advise you to identify and seek out what it is you desire from your life and get your priorities straight prioritize your guilty and innocent pleasures prioritize your love and prioritize your smile wherever it may be go for it remember that you all have it in you to prevail with whatever the storm of life throws at you and this has just been proven i can say this because we're all here gowned and proud in younger hall congratulations to you all

At the end of the graduation ceremony, all our new graduates will join the academic procession, leaving the younger hall and walking along North Street and entering. Since elevators quadrangle through the archway. To all other supporters here, Please wait until our new graduates have left the hall. Ushers will then show you to the nearest exit. Outside you will be directed to the quad where you will be able to join our new graduates. Please ensure that your mobile phone is switched off or at least on silent and then photography is welcome throughout the ceremony, but please stay in your seat if taking photographs. Now to capture this unique moment, our official photographer will now take a photograph of those graduating today before the ceremony begins. Good afternoon, the official photographer has got an official phone camera. Not because I haven't forgotten my other cameras. It's because this is getting the ultra wide lens on it. OK, we ready.

It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic, it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones. In the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decoration have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observed today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduand's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural and intellectual development since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient. History but creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors, often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics. All inspired by Aristotle speaking in the vernacular, was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in Latin which remained our official institutional language until 1747 examinations. Took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century St. Andrews as two distracting, but archery and important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted. This may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470, when after an unresolved argument the Dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows. Student life in St. Leonards College. Over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of a university founded within a religious capital, students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six. Started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now were it will be no surprise weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly forbidden, lest they, like football, should prove too distracting, with the exception of a single laundress. And on the condition that she was over 50 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Adam Ferguson, a renowned Enlightenment philosopher, graduated in 1742. James Wilson, a founding father of the United States, studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD's or Doctor of Medicine. By the university, the French revolutionary Jean Paul Marat in 1775. And in 1792 Edward Jenner, whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox, pioneered modern immunology. By the beginning of the 1800s, Saint Andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. A healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by way of the University Scotland Act of 1858 introduced the organizational structures which will remain mostly intact. To this day, women were admitted to full time study in 1892, and by the 1900s student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences. Perhaps the greatest evocation of this is the university's quincentenary celebrations of September 1911, which resemble our activities. Today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties spread across the town. Speeches were delivered. Representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed. A student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the Bell Pettigrew Museum, and the town came to life with song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in June 1929. Its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model. In honor of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes, it is their foresight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour. By leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better. As so many have done before them. Returning now to today's celebrations and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and I'm invested with the authority to award degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition, I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and I will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap. To most though, I will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduations into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, since our theaters Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins with the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Professor Dame Francis Kerwin. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates. Wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation.

I call upon Professor Kenneth Falconer of the School of Mathematics and Statistics. Vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science on Oris Kausa professor, Dame Francis Kerwin. A pure mathematician Francis took her doctorate at Oxford University working on algebraic and symplectic geometry at a time of spectacular advances in a research group that included many world leaders. After short periods of research at Harvard and in Paris, she returned to Oxford, where she has remained ever since. She became a professor in 1996 and in 2017 was elected civilian professor of geometry. Following in the steps of Edmund Halley and James Sylvester, and she was the first woman to hold this position. Algebraic geometry is a central area of mathematics concerning geometric objects that can be specified in terms of quadratic, cubic, or other polynomial equations. These vary from circles and... to far more complicated curves or surfaces that live in higher dimensional spaces. Curves of particular types may be classified by what are known as moduli spaces. For example, to describe a circle drawn on a piece of paper or a computer screen. If you only care about its size and not its position, then it is specified by a single positive number, its radius. Similarly, an ellipse may be represented by a point in a segment of the plane, its coordinates corresponding to the lengths of the long and short axes. Moving a point around this modular space corresponds to continuously deforming the... For more complicated geometric objects, the moduli space has become highly convoluted, twisting and doubling back on themselves in a complex manner. Francis's research provides descriptions of and insights into the moduli spaces for many classes of curves and surfaces in a way that reflects both their complexity and their mathematical elegance. Francis says research has been recognised by numerous awards, including last year by the Royal Society Sylvester Medal. But she has also given varied and outstanding service to the mathematical and scientific communities. She was only the second female president of the London Mathematical Society in its 150 year history as a Council member. At the time, I recall her unstinting efforts to raise the profile of mathematics in government and in the research councils. She is energetic and communicating mathematics at all levels. She has written several influential graduate texts, but she was also chair of the UK Mathematics Trust, which works to inspire a love of mathematics in school students. She has been particularly active in addressing the gender imbalance in mathematics and supporting women in combining mathematical careers with bringing up families, including as convener of European women in mathematics. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of her outstanding mathematical research and her service to mathematics. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science on our descalza on Professor Dame Francis Kerwan. Tea edgarton doctoris scientia honoris causa promovido curious ray in symbolum superette Hoke berekum imponer. And congratulations. So I've been invited to say just a very few words. I'm going to be very brief. I'm of course deeply grateful for this honour from Scotland's oldest university, in particular because my mother spent much of her childhood in Scotland. My grandmother was a Mackay, and so this beautiful country has always been very important to me. So what I really want to say is to add my congratulations to all of you who have just completed your degrees. A really great achievement, and particularly after such a difficult couple of years, so very, very well done so. As far as sort of advice for the future is concerned, well, you're going to to get some some from Sammy in a minute, but I did want to say so. I'm a great fan of the Australian songwriter and comedian Tim Minchin. And rather than listening to any advice from me, I recommend at some point listening to Tim Minchin's nine life lessons, which you can find on on YouTube. It's just five minutes of wise and funny advice he gave to graduating students when he was being given an honorary degree at his alma mater, the University of WA, so. You can, you can listen to to his life lessons yourselves, but here are some of them. So one thing he said was define yourself by what you love, not by what you dislike. Respect people with less power than you. And one thing that he he said twice over so. Don't don't rush into. Worrying about what you're going to do next so you don't have to have a dream. If you have a dream. Great go for it and with luck achieve it. But you really don't have to know yet what you're going to do with the rest of your lives, so enjoy today and many. Congratulations again. I call upon Doctor Sammy Michael of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. OK. So kind to have water here. Vice Chancellor's honored guests and the graduates of the class of 2022. Hello. It's I didn't write this bit. It's so nice to see you all here in person and I've just got a sea of beaming smiles in front of me right now, which is either happy that you graduated or because I'm the only thing blocking you from the garden party. Not sure which, but probably a better both. So I have some profound advice to deliver, so we're powerless to stem the passing of time we move forward with the promise of tomorrow, and we live in the present. Today, now let's bask in the glow of your glory. You've done well. University life will shape you forever and this has been the case for every university in every country in every year since the earlier senses of learning churned out scholars. In the case of this cohort, we all experience something unprecedented during your time, and I'm referring of course to studying and doing research during a global pandemic past few years have been some of the most difficult in my life, and from what I've seen and heard from students in our school. Some of the most challenging for a significant number if not all of you. Now, successfully completing a degree at Saint Andrews's, respected globally valued, celebrated. But doing so during the COVID-19 pandemic is an achievement we shouldn't understate, nor overlook. And this provides you all with an advantage moving forward. So. Endurance. Determination, adaptability. These are words that could be keywords that apply to you all, one or all of them. Don't forget that. Hold that to yourself and remind yourself the next time you face a bump or a problem on the horizon. What you've been through and that you are sitting here today, graduating. Also remember and I'm sure you're aware that none of you and none of us succeed alone and friends and family are the most precious commodity in existence. And you shouldn't take either for granted. And acknowledge, though, that the bonds which connect us. Up to the ones we love require effort from all parties to maintain their strength. And so if you haven't heard from someone you love, or just like a lot, and they haven't text you in six months, text them doesn't have to be profound. Just dig around for a little meme that you know made them laugh back in uni. Send it to them and they'll sit there and feel a warm hug coming through the phone. Because we found during this time period that technology is on our side, really, there's a the positive side too. The World Wide Web smartphones. We can stay in touch despite the best efforts of distance and time zones which would otherwise just drive us apart. So I advise you all to stay connected to one another as you venture across this planet on your journey to wherever to to to whatever with whoever has your new and status as graduates. My dad, who's Egyptian always told me when I was young. A degree is even better than a passport and a degree from a top university in the UK. The whole world is yours. That is one of the few things he said. That's absolutely true. So now you've all graduated with a range of degrees. Today I've heard a lot of degrees mentioned. We have MAFM lip, BSc, MSC, PhD. So what's next? Well, I'm gonna hit you with a fact. The path to success is nonlinear. Now. This means that it doesn't progress or develop in a straight line from one place to the next in any logical or predictable order, actually. And in addition to that, the definition of success is deeply personal. There is no definition of success. We all desire different things in and from our lives. We are all unique. We are all weird. We are all distinct. Over the coming years, you're all going to have to make some big life changing decisions. Such as which jobs you apply for which of those jobs that you're offered you accept? And something that might not have crossed your mind yet is sometimes when you get offered a job, you decline it. You don't have to take the job. Where you're gonna live and with whom you will share your life. So bear in mind that this morning yesterday morning and forevermore, as long as you're alive, you're the only person who wakes up and has the task of living your life. So when you think of it this way. Why would you let someone else write the script on the story of your life? I advise you to identify and seek out what it is you desire from your life and get your priorities straight. Prioritize your guilty and innocent pleasures. Prioritize your love and prioritize your smile. Wherever it may be, go for it. Remember that you all have it in you to prevail with whatever the storm of life throws at you. And this has just been proven. I can say this because we're all here. Gowned and proud in younger hall. Congratulations to you all. Please stand for the benediction. Gratia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas day. At Communicatio spiritual sanctity, sitkum omnibus nobis in secular siculum Amen."
