is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july two thousand and nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the angel hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduand 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors also it's not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the universities foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a center for pilgrimage home to scotland senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later of the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king robert the third and later as tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for eighteen years king james revisited saint andrew throughout his life celebrating christmas here in fourteen twenty five and he was so enamoured by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the sixth of scotland and first of england visited saint andrews in sixteen seventeen and made a gift of two hundred volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in sixteen forty three on south street this was a key moment for the early library but one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary's college from fifteen eighty and as rector from fifteen ninety melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence we enjoyed such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen 's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in two thousand and five we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may twenty twenty one and earlier this week we unveiled a fortieth birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the universities wardlaw museum our recently redeveloped museum situated on the scores which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fife to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is one from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as saint salvator 's chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all after which the presentation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition the chancellor will call upon the dean to present candidates for degrees from their faculty and he will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at super tay 's meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete since our theaters chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion the choir will today be directed by doctor michael downes director of music we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor carol hillenbrand to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor ali ansari from the school of history the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artus artium chancellor i have the honour to present for the degree of master of arts with honours rebecca alcaraz tay at grantham registry altium

medieval islamic world with seminal contributions to our understanding of muslim perspectives on the crusades as well as to the public 's understanding of islam carol studies though started in a rather different area her first degree was at cambridge in modern and medieval languages she was the first student there to study romanian was a particularly enthusiast for medieval french after graduation her language skills were in much demand and she spent two years in the ministry of aviation clarence moved medieval to middle eastern studies she describes as a fluke but a very romantic one at a party she noticed a man with piercing blue eyes they didn't speak but the man obviously noticed her too and he asked the hostess for carol 's telephone number julie phoned her and asked her to give up her job and visit turkey and that was her future husband robert now another medi renowned medievalist who i'm pleased to say joins us here today following the trip together to eastern turkey they both applied to oxford carol visited somerville college and asked the principal whether she would be allowed to do arabic the principal had in fact lived in baghdad for nine years and said she would be delighted at last to have a student doing arabic further languages were added turkish and then persian developed during a year in iran with robert carol then moved to edinburgh gaining a PHD in nineteen seventy nine and being appointed lecturer and then reader in arabic before becoming then professor of islamic history in two thousand her retirement in two thousand eight turned out to be saint andrews game and she spent what she describes as a very enjoyable years here attached to this university as professorial fellow in islamic history from twenty thirteen to twenty twenty one she lectured to first years and to postgraduates until and taught two honours courses one enticingly entitled the assassins carroll 's numerous and widely translated books include the crusade islamic perspectives published in nineteen ninety nine and islam a new historical introduction published in twenty fifteen her honours are equally numerous in two thousand five she was the first non muslim and the first woman to win the king faisal international prize in islamic studies in two thousand and seven she was elected fellow of the british academy in two thousand and twelve corresponding fellow at the medieval academy of america and in twenty eighteen she was made commander at the british empire CBE for enhancing interfaith understanding carlson 's generosity to others is immense i remember delightful afternoon at her house when she provided help to a young scholar suddenly confronted with doing research on islamic conflict conduct of war carol then entertained that scholars ten month old baby with equal enthusiasm and expressed disappointment only when we had to leave before the carefully chilled bottle of wine was produced from the fridge chancellor in recognition of her outstanding academic career and her contributions to the field of middle middle eastern studies and invite to confer the degree of doctor of letters on norris kalser on professor carol hillenbrand taya graham dot taught us that there are menorahs kaza promethium could you spray in symbolum sulphate be impotent i should like to express my warmest thanks to the chancellor of the university of saint andrews the right honourable lord campbell of pittenweem and my deep gratitude to the principle and vice chancellor professor dane sally mapstone for honouring me today i'm most grateful to my laureato professor john hudson for his kindness enthusiastic help and support and greatly enjoyed teaching at saint andrews my colleagues and administrators working in the department of medieval history have been most welcoming and the students have been very eager to learn about the middle east which itself has been a continuing inspiration for me even at my advanced age i will not forget this wonderful experience and today here sets the seal on it thank you i call upon professor ali ansari of the school of history chancellor 's principal honorary graduate colleagues graduates and special guests welcome to saint andrews where the the sun shines mostly although very much today and the welcome is most definitely warm i offer our most recent graduates my warmest congratulations on having made it especially in these extraordinary times and i suspect also i think i ought to congratulate their parents too few cohorts will have achieved what you have done lived worked and succeeded through what we may in time come to know as the great pandemic but if that were not enough you now enter the world at a time of particular turbulence with events those great disruptors of the comfort of routine being thrown at us with alarming frequency as you launch yourselves onto the treadmill of life heads down determined to whether the gathering storms that want to throw you off course as students at saint andrews you will have had very practical training on how to cope with this of course it may be opportune to pause for thought we may be excused for thinking that time itself is accelerating not only is there an apparent quickening of events but information is being produced and circulated at alarming rates a result of the digital revolution which has almost unknowingly shaped all our lives it has framed the way we think about the world and arguably forced us to think in different ways it has been calculated that in twenty sixteen the total amount of data produced globally equaled the total produced at that point in time that currently it doubles every year and that by twenty twenty seven it will double every twelve hours how data is evaluated analyzed converted information and then knowledge the coherent application of that information is a matter that should concern us all one of the great paradoxes of our times is that while we enjoy a surfeit of data and an abundance of information we have by contrast a poor city of knowledge such a preponderance of information is difficult to manage we cope by dealing with the immediate and haste to avoid being overwhelmed a succession of short term exercises we live in what i like to call a sat nav culture and have developed a mentality accordingly focus squarely on the task in hand we aim to get to our destination in the shortest possible time using the most direct route sean of any distraction which might divert us destination achieved we tick the box and move to the next task as a process it is short sharp but very much devoid of context not only has time accelerated but the space within which we operate appears to have shrunk yeah this is a product of our digital circumstances not a reflection of reality it is a choice perhaps one impressed upon us but a choice nonetheless so as you exit this university into the wide wide world i want you to periodically periodically step off that treadmill and pause for that one precious commodity which you possess thought look up think about the world about you and your place within it shut down that sat nav unfurl the map spread it out and look at that broader context and your situation within it cultivate your curiosity obviously honed here after years of hard work do not be afraid to explore and expand your horizons and above all do not be afraid to fail take a deep breath and take the longview i think you will find it worth your while congratulations and good luck please stand for the benediction gratzi and domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritual sanctity sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum ahmed",

and he asked the hostess for carol's telephone number julie phoned her and asked her to give up her job and visit turkey and that was her future husband robert now another medi renowned medievalist who i'm pleased to say joins us here today following the trip together to eastern turkey they both applied to oxford carol visited somerville college and asked the principal whether she would be

deep gratitude to the principle and vice chancellor professor dane sally mapstone for honouring me today i'm most grateful to my laureato professor john hudson for his kindness enthusiastic help and support and greatly enjoyed teaching at saint andrews my colleagues and administrators working in the department of medieval history have been most welcoming and the students have been very eager to learn about the middle east which itself has been a continuing inspiration for me even at my advanced age i will not forget this wonderful experience and today here sets the seal on it thank you i call upon professor ali ansari of the school of history chancellor's principal honorary graduate colleagues graduates and special guests welcome to saint andrews where the the sun shines mostly although very much today and the welcome is most definitely warm ioffer our most recent graduates my warmest congratulations on having made it especially in these extraordinary times and i suspect also i think i ought to congratulate their parents too few cohorts will have achieved what you have done lived worked and succeeded through what we may in time come to know as the great pandemic but if that were not enough you now enter the world at a time of particular turbulence with events those great disruptors of the comfort of routine being thrown at us with alarming frequency as you launch yourselves onto the treadmill of life heads down determined to whether the gathering storms that want to throw you off course as students at saint andrews you will have had very practical training on how to cope with this of course it may be opportune to pause for thought we may be excused for thinking that time itself is accelerating not only is there an apparent quickening of events but information is being produced and circulated at alarming rates a result of the digital revolution which has almost unknowingly shaped all our lives it has framed the way we think about the world and arguably forced us to think in different ways it has been calculated that in 2016 the total amount of data produced globally equaled the total produced at that point in time that currently it doubles every year and that by 2027 it will double every 12 hours how data is evaluated analyzed converted information and then knowledge the coherent application of that information is a matter that should concern us all one of the great paradoxes of our times is that while we enjoy a surfeit of data and an abundance of information we have by contrast a poor city of knowledge such a preponderance of information is difficult to manage we cope by dealing with the immediate and haste to avoid being overwhelmed a succession of short term exercises we live in what i like to call a sat nav culture and have developed a mentality accordingly focus squarely on the task in hand we aim to get to our destination in the shortest possible time using the most direct route sean of any distraction which might divert us destination achieved we tick the box and move to the next task as a process it is short sharp but very much devoid of context not only has time accelerated but the space within which we operate appears to have shrunk yeah this is a product of our digital circumstances not a reflection of reality it is a choice perhaps one impressed upon us but a choice nonetheless so as you exit this university into the wide wide world i want you to periodically periodically step off that treadmill and pause for that one precious commodity which you possess thought look up think about the world about you and your place within it shut down that sat nav unfurl the map spread it out and look at that broader context and your situation within it cultivate your curiosity obviously honed here after years of hard work do not be afraid to explore and expand your horizons and above all do not be afraid to fail take a deep breath and take the longview i think you will find it worth your while congratulations and good luck please stand for the benediction gratzi and domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritual sanctity sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum

Tua Vitam Itanium consumer per year. To increase them Dominum nostrum. Amen. Please be seated. I called upon the principle of the university. Good morning everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic congratulation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Today's graduates will cross the Angel hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have, for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduand's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years. Students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Also, it's not, however, a story of survival, but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the Universities Foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a Center for pilgrimage home to Scotland senior Bishop, and consecrated. Upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. The royal leaders of Scotland and later of the United Kingdom have been a guiding, enriching and at times challenging presence in our history. Saint Andrews was the spiritual home of Scotland and on occasion hosted the Scottish Court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the Royal household. Our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, served as an adviser and diplomat to King Robert the 3rd and later as tutor and Protector to his son, the future King James, the first of Scotland, who resided with him in Saint Andrews Castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to France. Which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in England for 18 years. King James Revisited St. Andrew throughout his life. Celebrating Christmas here in 1425. And he was so enamoured by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to Perth. His request was dutifully and happily ignored. Our university library, the oldest continuous library in Scotland, is indebted to royal patronage. King James, the 6th of Scotland and 1st of England visited St. Andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the University Library. A building in his honour to accommodate this collection, the King James Library was completed in 1643 on South St. This was a key moment for the early library, but one suspects that King James was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign. King James clashed repeatedly with Andrew Melville, a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as Principal of Saint Mary's College from 1580 and as rector from 1590. Melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university, but was resistant to royal interference. Given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether, King James locked Melville in the Tower of London. Royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to Lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence. We enjoyed such status today in a month in which we are celebrating Her Majesty the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. We have been honoured by the presence of Her Majesty periodically throughout her reign, most recently at the graduation of our alumni, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in 2005. We were delighted to welcome their Royal Highnesses back to the university for a visit in May 2021 and earlier this week, we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge at the Universities Wardlaw Museum. Our recently redeveloped museum, situated on the scores, which is well worth a visit. In crossing today's stage, each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps, but also in the footsteps of the academics, leaders and Changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of Fife to shape the world in profound ways. The journey you make from here is yours to envisage, but their example is 1, from which we can all draw inspiration. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as St Salvator's Chapel Choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor. Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all, after which the presentation of degrees by the Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will commence. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony, and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition. The Chancellor will call upon the Dean to present candidates for degrees from their faculty, and he will then confer the degree with Latin phrases. One of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap. To most though, the Chancellor will simply say at Super Tay's meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, since our theaters Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion, the choir will today be directed by Doctor Michael Downes, director of Music. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Professor Carol Hillenbrand. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates. Wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Professor Ali Ansari from the School of History. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So while you were graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life. Decanus faculty Artus artium.

I call upon Bishop Wardlaw, Professor John Hudson of the School of History. Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters on Norris Kausler, Professor Carol Hillenbrand. Carol Hillenbrand is among the former scholars of the medieval Islamic world. With seminal contributions to our understanding of Muslim perspectives on the Crusades as well as to the public's understanding of Islam. Carol studies, though, started in a rather different area. Her first degree was at Cambridge in modern and medieval languages. She was the first student there to study Romanian. Was a particularly enthusiast for medieval French after graduation. Her language skills were in much demand and she spent two years in the Ministry of Aviation. Clarence moved medieval to Middle Eastern studies. She describes as a fluke. But a very romantic one. At a party she noticed a man with piercing blue eyes. They didn't speak, but the man obviously noticed her too and he asked the Hostess for Carol's telephone number. Julie phoned her and asked her to give up her job and visit Turkey and that was her future husband Robert. Now another Medi renowned medievalist who I'm pleased to say joins us here today. Following the trip together to Eastern Turkey, they both applied to Oxford. Carol visited Somerville College and asked the principal whether she would be allowed to do Arabic. The principal had in fact lived in Baghdad for nine years and said she would be delighted at last to have a student doing Arabic. Further, languages were added Turkish and then Persian developed during a year in Iran with Robert. Carol then moved to Edinburgh, gaining a PhD in 1979 and being appointed lecturer and then reader in Arabic. Before becoming then professor of Islamic History in 2000. Her retirement in 2008 turned out to be Saint Andrews game. And she spent what she describes as a very enjoyable years here attached to this university as professorial fellow in Islamic history from 2013 to 2021. She lectured to first years and to postgraduates until and taught 2 honours courses, one enticingly entitled The Assassins. Carroll's numerous and widely translated books include the Crusade Islamic Perspectives published in 1999 and Islam, a new historical introduction published in 2015. Her honours are equally numerous. In 2005, she was the first non Muslim and the first woman to win the King Faisal International Prize in Islamic Studies. In 2007, she was elected fellow of the British Academy. In 2012, corresponding fellow at the medieval Academy of America. And in 2018, she was made commander at the British Empire CBE for enhancing interfaith understanding. Carlson's generosity to others is immense. I remember delightful afternoon at her house when she provided help to a young scholar suddenly confronted with doing research on Islamic conflict, conduct of war. Carol then entertained that scholars 10 month old baby with equal enthusiasm. And expressed disappointment only when we had to leave before the carefully chilled bottle of wine was produced from the fridge. Chancellor, in recognition of her outstanding academic career and her contributions to the field of Middle, Middle Eastern studies and invite to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters on Norris Kalser on Professor Carol Hillenbrand. Taya Graham dot taught us that there are menorahs kaza promethium. Could you spray in symbolum sulphate be impotent? I should like to express my warmest thanks to the Chancellor of the University of Saint Andrews, the right Honourable Lord Campbell of Pittenweem, and my deep gratitude to the principle and Vice Chancellor Professor Dane Sally Mapstone for honouring me today. I'm most grateful to my laureato. Professor John Hudson for his kindness enthusiastic help and support. And greatly enjoyed teaching at Saint Andrews. My colleagues and administrators working in the Department of Medieval History have been most welcoming and the students have been very eager to learn about the Middle East, which itself has been a continuing inspiration for me, even at my advanced age. I will not forget this wonderful experience and today here sets the seal on it. Thank you. I call upon Professor Ali Ansari of the School of History. Chancellor's principal honorary graduate colleagues, graduates, and special guests. Welcome to Saint Andrews where the the sun shines mostly. Although very much today and the welcome is most definitely warm. Ioffer our most recent graduates. My warmest congratulations on having made it, especially in these extraordinary times, and I suspect, also, I think I ought to congratulate their parents too. Few cohorts will have achieved what you have done, lived, worked, and succeeded through what we may in time come to know as the great pandemic. But if that were not enough, you now enter the world at a time of particular turbulence with events. Those great disruptors of the comfort of routine being thrown at us with alarming frequency. As you launch yourselves onto the treadmill of life, heads down, determined to whether the gathering storms that want to throw you off course as students at Saint Andrews, you will have had very practical training on how to cope with this. Of course, it may be opportune to pause for thought. We may be excused for thinking that time itself is accelerating. Not only is there an apparent quickening of events, but information is being produced and circulated at alarming rates. A result of the digital revolution which has almost unknowingly shaped all our lives. It has framed the way we think about the world and arguably forced us to think in different ways. It has been calculated that in 2016 the total amount of data produced globally equaled the total produced at that point in time. That currently it double s every year and that by 2027 it will double every 12 hours. How data is evaluated, analyzed, converted information and then knowledge. The coherent application of that information is a matter that should concern us all. One of the great paradoxes of our times is that while we enjoy a surfeit of data and an abundance of information we have, by contrast, a poor city of knowledge. Such a preponderance of information is difficult to manage. We cope by dealing with the immediate and haste to avoid being overwhelmed. A succession of short term exercises. We live in what I like to call a sat NAV culture and have developed a mentality accordingly. Focus squarely on the task in hand. We aim to get to our destination in the shortest possible time, using the most direct route. Sean, of any distraction which might divert us. Destination achieved we tick the box and move to the next task. As a process, it is short, sharp but very much devoid of context. Not only has time accelerated. But the space within which we operate appears to have shrunk. Yeah, this is a product of our digital circumstances, not a reflection of reality. It is a choice, perhaps one impressed upon us, but a choice nonetheless. So as you exit this university into the wide, wide world, I want you to periodically periodically step off that treadmill and pause for that one precious commodity which you possess thought. Look up, think about the world about you and your place within it. Shut down that sat NAV, unfurl the map, spread it out, and look at that broader context and your situation within it. Cultivate your curiosity. Obviously honed here after years of hard work. Do not be afraid to explore and expand your horizons. And above all. Do not be afraid to fail. Take a deep breath and take the Longview. I think you will find it worth your while. Congratulations and good luck. Please stand for the benediction. Gratzi and Domini Nostri Yesu Christi, at Caritas de at Communicatio spiritual sanctity, sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular Orum Ahmed."
