at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall was closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape the modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors also it's not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the universities foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of fifteenth century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history the scotty chronicon which also recounts the origins of the town and advances its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that saint rule was born in circa three hundred AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited one evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew 's far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint rule brought the relics which constituted one tooth one kneecap one humorous and saint andrews right hand to what bauer describes as the islands situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation 's patron saint the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued saint andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its six hundred years what about mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the fifteenth century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in fourteen seventy nine and fourteen ninety four respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglass 's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar 's poetry was amongst the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in fifteen oh eight and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin ennead into scots completing this in fifteen thirteen these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of saint leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst other many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the sixth of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in fifteen sixty five later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin poetry delici portalarium scott torum was sponsored by a graduate an early philanthropist of our university john scott in sixteen thirty seven and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews whilst the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from seventeen sixty five to seventeen sixty eight and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by william mure an early female graduate of our university in nineteen ten who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that the muers perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today hosts some of the world 's foremost literary scholars and alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our vetas chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all after which the presentation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence the conferral of these awards at bachelor 's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrew 's tradition the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i placed upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduations into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our academic community when the conferrals are complete since our vetas chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion the choir will today be directed by doctor michael downes director of music we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour sebastian faulks i will deliver the graduation address to close our ceremony a traditional message of congratulation and we hope inspiration to our new graduates the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life the canoes facultas artium

went as a top scholar to wellington college then when an open exhibition to read english it's a manual college cambridge graduating in nineteen seventy four in the year between school and university he had studied in paris and learned to speak french he subsequently worked on various newspapers including the sunday telegraph the independent and the guardian however his success as a novelist meant that in a two thousand and five interview he could say i haven't had a proper job for years and would now be unemployable many of us well no sebastian foxes considerable body of work from the trilogy of novels that establishes early reputation nineteen eighty nines the girl that leon door the powerful first world war contemporary classic birdsong from nineteen ninety three and in nineteen ninety nine charlotte gray a beautifully nuanced study of special operations agent in vichy france during world war two the following decades brought a highly diverse group of novels on green dolphin street a study of american life in the mid century human traces in which folks explores the treatment of mental disease and the dark and morally complex engleby are two of the flaws in the unreliable narrator genre of which telegraph critic james shilling said angley is distinguished by a remarkably remarkable intellectual energy a narrative verve technical mastery of the possibilities of novel form sorry novel form and a vivid sense of the tragic contingency of human life most recently the sunday times best seller snow country appeared in twenty twenty one a book that in the words of guardian critic stephanie merritt powerfully evokes the mood of a continent that still has not processed its collective trauma even as the threat of another looms it is in many respects a classic false novel and it's engagement with fundamental ideas of history freedom memory and hope seen through the eyes of characters who remain unforgettably etched on the readers mind long after the novel closes according to its publishers snow country marks the second volume of projected trilogy austrian trilogy which began with human faces which means that there is much to hope for in the coming years news that should gladden all lovers of fine fiction for sebastian faulks is undeniably as surely notes a master of the novel form though he claims to have no scientific background at all sebastian faulks has been honoured by the tavistock clinic in recognition of his contribution to the understanding of understanding of psychiatry and human traces as part of his work with the

speech at the vigil on the previous evening currently he is chair of the charlotte aikin trust an organization that aims to continue the work of the great literary critic given aiken by encouraging and promoting new literary talents in the twenty eighteen interview with kate callaway he said i know writers in their sixties who have told me candidly that their writing in order to help pay the bills and no longer have any real zip or desire which i always feel but the glorious thing is just beyond my reach many readers would argue that he has already achieved most all the most extraordinary glorious things in his writing but we can be thankful that he continues to possess the zip and desire that strive for further glories chancellor and recognition of his major contribution to literature i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters on norris kausa on sebastian faulks tay i'd gradom doctors letter arum anolis kaiser from movie curious arabian symbolum superette hope retirement pono congratulations well good evening and thank you very much and i would like to thank the principal and the chancellor and the university of saint andrews for this honorary doctorate i don't really know what i have done to deserve it unlike most of you in the hall who have worked hard in difficult circumstances and are free to celebrate today i have merely gone about my business but it is an honour i feel it and i thank you very much it means a lot to me that i should have been introduced to you by john burnside whose work i've admired for many years and with some professors of creative writing in some universities you wonder quite what their qualifications are to hold forth on this tricky subject and saint andrews is truly blessed in having one of the outstanding british poets of his generation to teach the students here so i think it's probably right that an old guy like me should give a few words of advice which you can now ignore about your future i could do it in latin but we've probably had enough light and so as i stick to english i have really only three things to say to you first of all and above all else congratulations but people of my generation and we have a younger son twenty two who graduated sorry he's not twenty two twenty four now he graduated two years ago from manchester finishing his degree online living at home with his parents which was lovely for us but not so lovely for him bit of my generation really do understand the difficult times that you've had as students and it's been hard hard going and you now have one through and the sun is shining you've finished the plague is in retreat and it's a wonderful sunny day in this beautiful city of saint andrews and i hope you will enjoy today and party on for a good time yet on a slightly more serious note i would urge those of you who are graduating that this is not the end of your education it is only the beginning you will read far more books in the years after your education has finished it finished it is then you have during your time as a student on my desk at home at the moment sit various books one of which is an A level guide to revision in biology so even at my age i'm still trying to learn and put right the gaps in my own education so please don't think of this as the end it is only the beginning and when you go out into the world now you're being told how very difficult it is a few unscrupulous bankers of my generation stole most of the money a few years ago and the rest of us have taken all the houses and the flats where you may have hoped to live i'm sorry but let me tell you it was always hard when i had my got my first job as a teacher in nineteen seventy five inflation was at twenty one percent i signed up to teach us the junior english master at two thousand seven hundred and fifty a year in august and when i started in late september my salary had gone up already to three thousand so that's it's never been easy and what i want to say to you is don't give up nil desperado there are jobs there are worlds out there there are futures the in in ways and in subjects and in ways of making a living in a mark which i barely understand but which i'm sure you will understand better than i do and and finally i would like to say keep stay with your friends the friends you've made at university they these may be the best friends that you ever have don't think as you zoom off to different parts of the world and different jobs and different adventures don't forget the friends you've made in this time i had lunch about two weeks ago with two my two best friends from university and we realised it was the first time the three of us have been in the same room for fifty years don't let that happen to you so finally once more congratulations to you all and i wish you all the very very best of luck i called upon the principle of the university it now falls upon me to deliver today's graduation address and it is conventional to begin with a wholehearted and emphatic note of congratulations you have done it in collecting your degree you complete an intellectual journey that has demanded sustained investment across many months or years as well as intellectual curiosity and sheer hard work these capabilities have sharpened during your program and you do leave better equipped for what comes next indeed better able to envisage and create your own path a degree from saint andrews as we know is not easily attained but it is something that you have earned and which nobody can take away from you you and your friends your families your teachers and your peers have every right to feel very proud today and i'd like you to join with me in giving yourselves a huge round of applause OK OK it's it's nearly party time it's not quite party time now you also have more to celebrate than most for two years the pandemic ruptured the conventional delivery of teaching and demanded that you exercise greater dexterity than any of your forebears i know it has not been simple but in coming through a time of great challenge with something of equally great value to show for it you have demonstrated a quintessentially saint andrews spirit of endeavour and excellence during some of the most severe lockdowns necessitated by the pandemic whether spent in saint andrews or elsewhere reading and learning were two of the great reliefs of daily life for many of us they were supplemented by exercise i was in saint andrews throughout the pandemic years and exercise here first took the form of our daily government allowed thirty minute dash out of the house which later proliferated when outdoor activities were increasingly enabled into much longer stretches of walking hiking and running a poor city of tourists and at times students and staff made saint andrews the quiet place for those of those who remained but it's beaches and streets were unfailingly punctuated by people running or walking their way through the anxieties of the moment this draws upon a long tradition of exercise at saint andrews in which running has been used as a way to offset the stresses of studying by generations of students before your enrollment here some of your attending guests may have been more familiar with our town as either the home of golf or as the setting of the opening sequence of the nineteen eighty one film chariots of fire that sequence in which a group of students run along the west hands toward saint andrews is one of the most iconic cinematic visuals in western film and it is of course accompanied by an equally iconic school by the composer vangelis who passed away just last month it is a scene recreated consciously or otherwise hundreds of times every day by the students who run across the sands and with more deliberate intent at the annual chariots of fire five K beach race the latest iteration of this event took place at the beginning of this month and it brought together seven hundred staff students and townsfolk for a community celebration of exercise in the landscape that we are so fortunate to inhabit further sources of athletic inspiration are present on our stage particularly in our own honourable chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem lord campbell is a polymath of renown a lawyer by training a parliamentarian of historic significance and an incisive foreign affairs and defence specialist lord campbell serves to this day as a member of the nato parliamentary assembly as part of a UK delegation that he led from two thousand and ten to two thousand and fifteen lord campbell is however also an olympian of equally historic proportions he competed at the nineteen sixty four tokyo olympics including in the four by one hundred metre relay at which he and his team established a new british record lord campbell subsequently competed in the nineteen sixty six commonwealth games he later defeated OJ simpson in a competitive one hundred meter race in nineteen sixty seven and the really aren't many people who can say that and from nineteen sixty seven to nineteen seventy four he held the national one hundred metre record in his autobiography published in two thousand and eight lord campbell recalls his feelings upon leaving tokyo as an olympian writing i worked for it dreamed of it and finally achieved it i remember it vividly as if it were yesterday like running studying is about perseverance about getting to the library or laboratory every day and doing the work it can often be a solitary activity and its rewards do not immediately manifest one must simply trust through that through repeated labour and constant endeavour a transformation occurs by degrees that through time leads both to distinct sharpening of one 's capabilities and the discovery of new understandings every assignment you completed every page you read or every experiment you conducted placed you one foot further forward and today we mark your completion of the race now running is not an activity that everyone enjoys some of you will default to other sports or the gentle pleasures of walking but every academic can relate to the central ethos of running a will towards self improvement that is wonderfully described by the japanese novelist haruki murakami in his two thousand memoir what i talk about when i talk about running and i'm quoting running day after day piling up the races bit by bit i raised the bar and by clearing each level i elevate myself the point is whether or not i improved over yesterday in long distance running distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself the way you used to be your time studying as part of the class of twenty twenty two is over while you will always be part of the rich and inclusive alumni community the track ahead is one that you must pursue alone guided by your principles and impulses that is a daunting prospect but it is a tremendously exciting one it's time to set your own standards and aspirations saint andrews has equipped you with the skills knowledge and perseverance necessary to excel in anything you wish to pursue and the future is yours run towards it because the prize is yours to take thank you i have to confess it is indeed true that i beat OJ simpson over a hundred metres i didn't realize quite how courageous i was being please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas today at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen yeah in the chariots very good for launching too",

calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929 the younger hall was closed in july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape the modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors also it's not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the universities foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the 12th century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in 1318 university instruction commenced here in may 1410 when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from peniscola in august 1413 which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history the scotty chronicon which also recounts the origins of the town and advances its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that st rule was born in circa 300 AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited 1 evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew's far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great st rule brought the relics which constituted one tooth 1 kneecap 1 humorous and saint andrews right hand to what bauer describes as the islands situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation's patron st the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued st andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its 600 years what about mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in 1479 and 1494 respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglass's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar's poetry was amongst the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in 1508 and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin ennead into scots completing this in 1513 these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of st leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst other many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the 6th of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in 1565 later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin poetry delici portalarium scott torum was sponsored by a graduate an early philanthropist of our university john scott in 1637 and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews whilst the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from 1765 to 1768 and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by william mure an early female graduate of our university in 1910 who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that the muers perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today hosts some of the world's foremost literary scholars and alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our vetas chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all after which the presentation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence the conferral of these awards at bachelor's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrew's tradition the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i placed upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduations into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our academic community when the conferrals are complete since our vetas chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion the choir will today be directed by doctor michael downes director of music we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour sebastian faulks i will deliver the graduation address to close our ceremony a traditional message of congratulation and we hope inspiration to our new graduates the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life the canoes facultas artium chancellor i have the honor to present for the degree of master of arts with honours ewan bowman terry had gradual magistry

remarkable intellectual energy a narrative verve technical mastery of the possibilities of novel form sorry novel form and a vivid sense of the tragic contingency of human life most recently the sunday times best seller snow country appeared in 2021 a book that in the words of guardian critic stephanie merritt powerfully evokes the mood of a continent that still has not processed its collective trauma even as the threat of another looms it is in many respects a classic false novel and it's engagement with fundamental ideas of history freedom memory and hope seen through the eyes of characters who remain unforgettably etched on the readers mind long after the novel closes according to its publishers snow country marks the second volume of projected trilogy austrian trilogy

their writing in order to help pay the bills and no longer have any real zip or desire which i always feel but the glorious thing is just beyond my reach many readers would argue that he has already achieved most all the most extraordinary glorious things in his writing but we can be thankful that he continues to possess the zip and desire that strive for further glories chancellor and recognition of his major contribution to literature i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters on norris kausa on sebastian faulks tay i'd gradom doctors letter arum anolis kaiser from movie curious arabian symbolum superette hope retirement pono congratulations well good evening and thank you very much and i would like to thank the principal and the chancellor and the university of saint andrews for this honorary doctorate i don't really know what i have done to deserve it unlike most of you in the hall who have worked hard in difficult circumstances and are free to celebrate today i have merely gone about my business but it is an honour i feel it and i thank you very much it means a lot to me that i should have been introduced to you by john burnside whose work i've admired for many years and with some professors of creative writing in some universities you wonder quite what their qualifications are to hold forth on this tricky subject and saint andrews is truly blessed in having one of the outstanding british poets of his generation to teach the students here so i think it's probably right that an old guy like me should give a few words of advice which you can now ignore about your future i could do it in latin but we've probably had enough light and so as i stick to english i have really only three things to say to you first of all and above all else congratulations but people of my generation and we have a younger son 22 who graduated sorry he's not 2224 now he graduated 2 years ago from manchester finishing his degree online living at home with his parents which was lovely for us but not so lovely for him bit of my generation really do understand the difficult times that you've had as students and it's been hard hard going and you now have one through and the sun is shining you've finished the plague is in retreat and it's a wonderful sunny day in this beautiful city of saint andrews and i hope you will enjoy today and party on for a good time yet on a slightly more serious note i would urge those of you who are graduating that this is not the end of your education it is only the beginning you will read far more books in the years after your education has finished it finished it is then you have during your time as a student on my desk at home at the moment sit various books one of which is an A level guide to revision in biology so even at my age i'm still trying to learn and put right the gaps in my own education so please don't think of this as the end it is only the beginning and when you go out into the world now you're being told how very difficult it is a few unscrupulous bankers of my generation stole most of the money a few years ago and the rest of us have taken all the houses and the flats where you may have hoped to live i'm sorry but let me tell you it was always hard when i had my got my first job as a teacher in 1975 inflation was at 21% i signed up to teach us the junior english master at 2750 a year in august and when i started in late september my salary had gone up already to 3000 so that's it's never been easy and what i want to say to you is don't give up nil desperado there are jobs there are worlds out there there are futures the in in ways and in subjects and in ways of making a living in a mark which i barely understand but which i'm sure you will understand better than i do and and finally i would like to say keep stay with your friends the friends you've made at university they these may be the best friends that you ever have don't think as you zoom off to different parts of the world and different jobs and different adventures don't forget the friends you've made in this time i had lunch about two weeks ago with two my two best friends from university and we realised it was the first time the three of us have been in the same room for 50 years don't let that happen to you so finally once more congratulations to you all and i wish you all the very very best of luck i called upon the principle of the university it now falls upon me to deliver today's graduation address and it is conventional to begin with a wholehearted and emphatic note of congratulations you have done it in collecting your degree you complete an intellectual journey that has demanded sustained investment across many months or years as well as intellectual curiosity and sheer hard work these capabilities have sharpened during your program and you do leave better equipped for what comes next indeed better able to envisage and create your own path a degree from saint andrews as we know is not easily attained but it is something that you have earned and which nobody can take away from you you and your friends your families your teachers and your peers have every right to feel very proud today and i'd like you to join with me in giving yourselves a huge round of applause OK OK it's it's nearly party time it's not quite party time now you also have more to celebrate than most for two years the pandemic ruptured the conventional delivery of teaching and demanded that you exercise greater dexterity than any of your forebears i know it has not been simple but in coming through a time of great challenge with something of equally great value to show for it you have demonstrated a quintessentially saint andrews spirit of endeavour and excellence during some of the most severe lockdowns necessitated by the pandemic whether spent in saint andrews or elsewhere reading and learning were two of the great reliefs of daily life for many of us they were supplemented by exercise i was in saint andrews throughout the pandemic years and exercise here first took the form of our daily government allowed 30 minute dash out of the house which later proliferated when outdoor activities were increasingly enabled into much longer stretches of walking hiking and running a poor city of tourists and at times students and staff made saint andrews the quiet place for those of those who remained but it's beaches and streets were unfailingly punctuated by people running or walking their way through the anxieties of the moment this draws upon a long tradition of exercise at saint andrews in which running has been used as a way to offset the stresses of studying by generations of students before your enrollment here some of your attending guests may have been more familiar with our town as either the home of golf or as the setting of the opening sequence of the 1981 film chariots of fire that sequence in which a group of students run along the west hands toward saint andrews is one of the most iconic cinematic visuals in western film and it is of course accompanied by an equally iconic school by the composer vangelis who passed away just last month it is a scene recreated consciously or otherwise hundreds of times every day by the students who run across the sands and with more deliberate intent at the annual chariots of fire 5K beach race the latest iteration of this event took place at the beginning of this month and it brought together 700 staff students and townsfolk for a community celebration of exercise in the landscape that we are so fortunate to inhabit further sources of athletic inspiration are present on our stage particularly in our own honourable chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem lord campbell is a polymath of renown a lawyer by training a parliamentarian of historic significance and an incisive foreign affairs and defence specialist lord campbell serves to this day as a member of the nato parliamentary assembly as part of a UK delegation that he led from 2010 to 2015 lord campbell is however also an olympian of equally historic proportions he competed at the 1964 tokyo olympics including in the four by 100 metre relay at which he and his team established a new british record lord campbell subsequently competed in the 1966 commonwealth games he later defeated OJ simpson in a competitive 100 meter race in 1967 and the really aren't many people who can say that and from 1967 to 1974 he held the national 100 metre record in his autobiography published in 2008 lord campbell recalls his feelings upon leaving tokyo as an olympian writing i worked for it dreamed of it and finally achieved it i remember it vividly as if it were yesterday like running studying is about perseverance about getting to the library or laboratory every day and doing the work it can often be a solitary activity and its rewards do not immediately manifest one must simply trust through that through repeated labour and constant endeavour a transformation occurs by degrees that through time leads both to distinct sharpening of 1's capabilities and the discovery of new understandings every assignment you completed every page you read or every experiment you conducted placed you one foot further forward and today we mark your completion of the race now running is not an activity that everyone enjoys some of you will default to other sports or the gentle pleasures of walking but every academic can relate to the central ethos of running a will towards self improvement that is wonderfully described by the japanese novelist haruki murakami in his 2000 memoir what i talk about when i talk about running and i'm quoting running day after day piling up the races bit by bit i raised the bar and by clearing each level i elevate myself the point is whether or not i improved over yesterday in long distance running distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself the way you used to be your time studying as part of the class of 2022 is over while you will always be part of the rich and inclusive alumni community the track ahead is one that you must pursue alone guided by your principles and impulses that is a daunting prospect but it is a tremendously exciting one it's time to set your own standards and aspirations saint andrews has equipped you with the skills knowledge and perseverance necessary to excel in anything you wish to pursue and the future is yours run towards it because the prize is yours to take thank you i have to confess it is indeed true that i beat OJ simpson over 100 metres i didn't realize quite how courageous i was being please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas today at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen yeah in the chariots very good for launching too",

I call upon the principle of the university. Good afternoon. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall was closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded. And some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape the modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Also, it's not, however, a story of survival, but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the Universities Foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. Walter Bauer, a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century Scotland, described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of Scottish history, the Scotty Chronicon, which also recounts the origins of the town and advances its place at the heart of our cultural imagination. Legend has it that St Rule was born in circa 300 AD and was a Bishop in Patras, Greece, when he was visited 1 evening by an Angel who instructed him to take the bones of Saint Andrew's far from the reach of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great St Rule brought the relics which constituted one tooth, 1 kneecap, 1 humorous and Saint Andrews right hand to what Bauer describes as the islands situated in the ocean. Beneath the setting sun. And it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in Saint Andrews, which have proven so formative for contemporary Scotland, developed with Saint Andrew, later becoming the nation's patron St. The lyrical origins of our town and university imbued St. Andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a Crucible for literary creativity. Throughout its 600 years. What about Mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas, who graduated in 1479 and 1494, respectively, and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early Modern Scotland. Dunbar and Douglass's use of Scots was foundational for much literature that followed. Dunbar's poetry was amongst the first items printed in Scotland by the Edinburgh Printers, Chapman and Miller in 1508, and Douglas was the first translator of VERGIL'S Latin Ennead into Scots. Completing this in 1513. These were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university, including one who would become Principal of St. Leonards College, George Buchanan. The most significant Latin poet of his time. Buchanan was amongst other many occupations, a tutor to Mary, Queen of Scots and later King James, the 6th of Scotland, and he served as a poet at Mary's Court, in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks, including a special Commission for the wedding of Mary to Lord Darnley. In 1565, later generations were equally influential. The first major printed anthology of Scottish Latin poetry, delici Portalarium Scott Torum, was sponsored by a graduate, an early philanthropist of our university, John Scott, in 1637. And while we cannot claim to have educated Robert Burns who lived degree less to his end days, Saint Andrews, whilst the academic home of the Scottish poet Robert Ferguson, who studied here from 1765 to 1768 and whom Burns held in higher esteem than all other writers. Literary life thrived in more recent centuries, and literary translation in particular was taken up by William Mure, an early female graduate of our university in 1910, who with her husband Edwin, translated works by such luminaries as Herman Brooke and Franz Kafka. The literary culture that the muers perpetuated complemented the research activities of our School of English, which today hosts some of the world's foremost literary scholars and alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners. We are highly distinctive in accommodating poets, dramatists and creatives including Professor Don Patterson OBE Professor John Burnside, and Professor Zinnie Harris, whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals, which connect us to our forebears. The first of these you have already witnessed as since our Vetas Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all, after which the presentation of degrees by the Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will commence. The conferral of these awards at Bachelor's Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. And degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrew's tradition, the chancellor will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and he will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I placed upon you this cap. To most though, the Chancellor will simply say. At Super Tay, meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduations into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our academic community. When the Conferrals are complete, since our Vetas Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins, for the Felicity they bring to this occasion, the choir will today be directed by Doctor Michael Downes, director of Music. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Sebastian Faulks. I will deliver the graduation address to close our ceremony. A traditional message of congratulation and we hope inspiration to our new graduates. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So while you were graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life. The canoes facultas artium. Chancellor.

In the year between school and university, he had studied in Paris and learned to speak French. He subsequently worked on various newspapers, including the Sunday Telegraph, the Independent, and The Guardian. However, his success as a novelist meant that in a 2005 interview, he could say I haven't had a proper job for years. And would now be unemployable. Many of us well, no Sebastian Foxes.

It is in many respects a classic false novel and it's engagement with fundamental ideas of history, freedom, memory and hope.

According to its publishers, Snow country marks the second volume of projected trilogy. Austrian trilogy, which began with human faces, which means that there is much to hope for in the coming years.

Which I always feel, but the glorious thing is just beyond my reach. Many readers would argue that he has already achieved. Most all the most extraordinary glorious things in his writing. But we can be thankful that he continues to possess the zip and desire that strive for further glories. Chancellor. And recognition of his major contribution to literature. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters on Norris Kausa. On Sebastian Faulks Tay, I'd gradom doctors letter Arum Anolis Kaiser from movie Curious Arabian Symbolum Superette Hope retirement Pono. Congratulations. Well, good evening and thank you very much and I would like to thank the principal and the Chancellor and the University of Saint Andrews for this honorary doctorate. I don't really know what I have done to deserve it, unlike most of you in the hall who have worked hard in difficult circumstances and are free to celebrate today. I have merely gone about my business, but it is an honour. I feel it, and I thank you. Very much. It means a lot to me that I should have been introduced to you by John Burnside, whose work I've admired for many years. And with some professors of creative writing, in some universities, you wonder quite what their qualifications are to hold forth on this tricky subject. And Saint Andrews is truly blessed in having one of the outstanding British poets of his generation. To teach. The students here. So I think it's probably right that an old guy like me should give a few words of advice which you can now ignore about your future. I could do it in Latin, but we've probably had enough light. And so as I stick to English, I have really only three things to say to you. First of all, and above all else, congratulations. But people of my generation and we have a younger son, 22 who graduated. Sorry, he's not 2224 now. He graduated 2 years ago from Manchester, finishing his degree online, living at home with his parents, which was lovely for us but not so lovely for him. Bit of my generation really do understand the difficult times that you've had as students and it's been hard, hard going and you now have one through and the sun is shining. You've finished, the plague is in retreat and it's a wonderful sunny day in this beautiful city of Saint Andrews and I hope you will enjoy today and party on for a good time. Yet on a slightly more serious note, I would urge those of you who are graduating that this is not the end of your education. It is only the beginning. You will read far more books in the years after your education has finished it finished. It is then you have during your time as a student. On my desk at home, at the moment sit various books, one of which is an A level guide to revision in biology. So even at my age I'm still trying to learn and put right the gaps in my own education, so please don't think of this as the end. It is only the beginning and when you go out into the world now you're being told how very difficult it is. A few unscrupulous bankers of my generation stole most of the money a few years ago. And the rest of us have taken all the houses and the flats where you may have hoped to live. I'm sorry. But let me tell you, it was always hard. When I had my got my first job as a teacher in 1975, inflation was at 21%. I signed up to teach us the junior English master at 2750, a year in August, and when I started in late September, my salary had gone up already to 3000, so that's it's never been easy and what I want to say to you is don't give up nil Desperado. There are jobs. There are worlds out there. There are futures. The in in ways and in subjects and in ways of making a living in a mark which I barely understand, but which I'm sure you will understand better than I do. And and finally I would like to say keep, stay with your friends the friends you've made at university, they these may be the best friends that you ever have. Don't think as you zoom off to different parts of the world and different jobs and different adventures. Don't forget the friends you've made in this time I had lunch about two weeks ago. With two, my two best friends from university and we realised it was the first time the three of us have been in the same room for 50 years. Don't let that happen to you. So finally, once more. Congratulations to you all and I wish you all the very, very best of luck. I called upon the principle of the university. It now falls upon me to deliver today's graduation address and it is conventional to begin with a wholehearted and emphatic note of congratulations. You have done it in collecting your degree. You complete an intellectual journey that has demanded sustained investment across many months or years as well as intellectual curiosity and sheer. Hard work. These capabilities have sharpened during your program and you do leave better equipped for what comes next. Indeed, better able to envisage and create your own path a degree from Saint Andrews as we know is not easily attained, but it is something that you have earned and which nobody can take away from you. You and your friends, your families, your teachers and your peers have every right to feel very proud. Today and I'd like you to join with me in giving yourselves a huge round of applause. OK. OK, it's it's nearly party time. It's not quite party time now. You also have more to celebrate than most. For two years the pandemic ruptured the conventional delivery of teaching and demanded that you exercise greater dexterity than any of your forebears. I know it has not been simple, but in coming through a time of great challenge with something of equally great value to show for it, you have demonstrated a quintessentially. Saint Andrews Spirit of Endeavour and Excellence. During some of the most severe lockdowns necessitated by the pandemic, whether spent in Saint Andrews or elsewhere, reading and learning were two of the great reliefs of daily life. For many of us, they were supplemented by exercise. I was in Saint Andrews throughout the pandemic years and exercise here first took the form of our daily government, allowed 30 minute dash out of the house, which later proliferated when outdoor activities were increasingly enabled into much longer stretches of walking, hiking, and running a poor city of tourists, and at times, students and staff made Saint Andrews. The quiet place for those of those who remained, but it's beaches and streets, were unfailingly punctuated by people running or walking their way through the anxieties of the moment. This draws upon a long tradition of exercise at Saint Andrews, in which running has been used as a way to offset the stresses of studying by generations of students. Before your enrollment here, some of your attending guests may have been more familiar with our town as either the home of golf or as the setting of the opening sequence of the 1981 film Chariots of Fire. That sequence in which a group of students run along the West hands toward Saint Andrews, is one of the most iconic cinematic visuals in Western film, and it is, of course, accompanied by an equally iconic school by the composer Vangelis. Who passed away just last month? It is a scene recreated consciously or otherwise hundreds of times every day by the students who run across the sands and with more deliberate intent at the annual Chariots of Fire 5K beach race. The latest iteration of this event took place at the beginning of this month and it brought together 700 staff students and townsfolk for a community celebration of exercise in the landscape that we are so fortunate to inhabit. Further sources of athletic inspiration are present on our stage, particularly in our own honourable Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem. Lord Campbell is a polymath of renown, a lawyer, by training a parliamentarian of historic significance and an incisive foreign affairs and defence. Specialist Lord Campbell serves to this day as a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly as part of a UK delegation that he led from 2010. To 2015 Lord Campbell is, however, also an Olympian of equally historic proportions. He competed at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, including in the four by 100 metre relay, at which he and his team established a new British record. Lord Campbell subsequently competed in the 1966 Commonwealth Games. He later defeated OJ Simpson in a competitive 100 meter race in 1967. And the really aren't many people who can say that, and from 1967 to 1974 he held the national 100 metre record in his autobiography, published in 2008, Lord Campbell recalls his feelings upon leaving Tokyo as an Olympian. Writing, I worked for it, dreamed of it and finally achieved it. I remember it vividly as if it were yesterday. Like running, studying is about perseverance about getting to the library or laboratory every day and doing the work. It can often be a solitary activity and its rewards do not immediately manifest. One must simply trust through that through repeated labour and constant endeavour, a transformation occurs by degrees that through time leads both to distinct sharpening of 1's capabilities and the discovery of new understandings. Every assignment you completed, every page you read or every experiment you conducted placed you one foot further forward. And today we mark your completion of the race. Now running is not an activity that everyone enjoys. Some of you will default to other sports or the gentle pleasures of walking, but every academic can relate to the central ethos of running a will towards self improvement that is wonderfully described by the Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami. In his 2000 memoir. What I talk about when I talk about running and I'm quoting. Running day after day piling up the races bit by bit, I raised the bar and by clearing each level I elevate myself. The point is whether or not I improved over yesterday in long distance running distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself. The way you used to be. Your time studying as part of the class of 2022 is over. While you will always be part of the rich and inclusive alumni community, the track ahead is one that you must pursue alone. Guided by your principles and impulses, that is a daunting prospect, but it is a tremendously exciting one. It's time to set your own standards and aspirations. Saint Andrews has equipped you with the skills, knowledge, and perseverance necessary to excel in anything you wish to pursue, and the future is yours. Run towards it because the prize is yours to take. Thank you. I have to confess it is indeed true that I beat OJ Simpson over 100 metres. I didn't realize quite how courageous I was being. Please stand for the benediction. Grazia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi at Caritas today at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen. Yeah, in the Chariots. Very good for launching too."
