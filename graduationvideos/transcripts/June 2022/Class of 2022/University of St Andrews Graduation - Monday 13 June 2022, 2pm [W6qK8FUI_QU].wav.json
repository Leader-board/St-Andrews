you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the young hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july two thousand and nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proven resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors all this however not only a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict thirteen issued papal bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into the town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king robert the third and later as a tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for eighteen years king james revisited saint andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas here in fourteen twenty five and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the sixth of scotland and first of england visited saint andrews in sixteen seventeen and made a gift of two hundred volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in sixteen forty three on south street this was a key moment for the early library well one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary's college from fifteen eighty and as rector from fifteen ninety melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lucky of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen 's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in two thousand and five we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may twenty twenty one our institutional museum the ward law recently redeveloped and situated on the schools will from today onwards display one of the three fortieth birthday portraits of the duchess of cambridge a venue selected by the duchess in partnership with the national portrait gallery in recognition of the influence of saint andrews upon her life the portrait and the ward law more broadly are well worth a visit during your time here in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and change makers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fifth to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make here from here is yours to envisage but their example is one from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connectors to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed a saint salvator 's chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say it superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from the saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete since our theaters chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor terrence cave to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor mark harris from the school of philosophical anthropological and film studies the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but are taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrew throughout your

for the degree of doctor of letters honoris causa professor terence cave professor terence cave CBE FB a chevalier donald or national demeritte is a leading figure in french and literary studies who has been influencing our understanding of literature for almost sixty years in this country and around the world his professional story began here at saint andrews as an assistant lecturer in french shortly after completing his studies at the university of cambridge he then moved to warwick university before settling in nineteen seventy two at oxford university as a fellow and tutor at saint john 's college he became university professor of french there in nineteen eighty nine and has been professor and fellow emeritus since two thousand and one during his long teaching career professor cave was to challenge inspire and by all accounts and in the nicest possible way thoroughly intimidate hundreds of students who like his colleagues praise his dedication humility and kindness as well as his tremendous intellect while he became known primarily for his contributions to french renaissance studies with books entitled the cornucopian text problems of writing in the french renaissance in nineteen seventy nine and pistoia volumes one and two in nineteen ninety nine and two thousand and one professor cave has also written on aristotelian poetics in recognitions in nineteen eighty eight and on the relations between literature and music menials afterlives twenty eleven his insights always transferred easily to the contemporary and other contexts but this became even more apparent after he was awarded the prestigious balzan prize in two thousand and nine and directed the groundbreaking project literature as an object of knowledge this positioned literary texts as unique works of human cognition and drew accordingly on methodologies from cognitive psychology neuroscience and philosophy amongst others to explore new approaches to literary criticism the books thinking with literature twenty sixteen reading beyond the code twenty eighteen and live artifacts twenty twenty two are among the outcomes of that project this considerable corpus is consistently interested in precisely problems of writing the purpose and uses of literature the ways in which we read and write and reread and rewrite from one age culture mode of inquiry thought or expression to another are some of the infinitely complex questions that professor cave tirelessly addresses his expertise encompasses every genre and ranges from habler pulsar and montagne to shakespeare gerter elliott conrad and angela carter his style is limpid and elegant but also warm amusing and frankly thrilling in that his reader invariably finds herself impatient to know what happens next how one idea will lead to another and what the conclusion will be professors caves is a body of work of outstanding importance that has altered approaches to literature across languages and generations and perhaps uniquely it has made generations of readers really smile as they studied it vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to french and literary studies i ask you to confer the degree of doctor of letters on oresko USA on professor terence cave tea at gradam doctoris litteram honoris causa promouvoir couriers ray in symbolum superette hope bradham imponent congratulation vice chancellor laureata fellow grudge rounds colleagues students families and friends i hardly need to say that i'm deeply grateful to the university of saint andrews and its officers for choosing to confer on me this extraordinary honour more personally i'd like to offer my warmest thanks to the vice chancellor professor sally mapstone for presiding over this process and for hosting us me and my wife in great luxury in her beautiful house on the scores i'm deeply grateful to professor lorna milne the large data for taking on the job this obvious job arduous job and i'm both moved and humbled by the generous account she gave of my career through professor miller i'd like also to express my gratitude to the french department at saint andrews who presumably played a crucial role in the nomination process fiona thompson the executive officer to the principal 's office guided me expertly through all the administrative requirements and made detailed arrangements on the ground and i want to take this opportunity to offer her too my sincerest thanks so now a brief word to you my fellow graduands it's a great privilege for me to share this event with you and to be present at such a critical moment in your lives i'm at the other end of that trajectory it's in fact exactly sixty years since i came to saint andrews for my first proper academic job in nineteen sixty two so in a sense it's my diamond jubilee jubilee i've got a long way to go to catch up with the queen but i'm working on it i can clearly recall arriving one autumn day that year nineteen sixty two and finding the bunk i've been assigned to in a tall stone building on murray park i had a room at the top of the house and from there at night i could hear the sound of the sea breaking on the rocks below the scores i fell in love with the place straight away and had three wonderful years here and my other things i learned a great deal about teaching i could go into that in more detail but it would take too long the memory of my time in saint andrews has remained with me ever since refreshed by occasional trips as an external examiner or a guest lecturer and it's an absolute delight to come back on this occasion most of you will go on to have very different lives from mine and i hope they'll be happy and successful ones but the one thing you and i all share regardless of the years that separate us is the experience of spending a key part of our earlier lives in this place so if i have a message for you it would simply be this you've had the opportunity and the privilege to study at world class university in an incomparably beautiful setting let that memory become and remain a part of your future life whatever career you may be thinking of it will enrich you and give you values to take with you wherever you go and i'll conclude on a more serious note by echoing the words of ringo starr i saw recently on the BBC website that he'd been given an honorary doctorate by an academy of music in boston and they transcribed his acceptance speech which ran as follows i just want to say thank you and peace and love i can't do better than that peace and love i call upon professor mark harris of the school of philosophical anthropological and film studies vice chancellor 's colleagues graduates and special guests heartfelt congratulations to each graduate if you're a philosopher you will now be able to make a truly logical argument that only the best minds will beat that will stand you in very good stead for the rest of your life if you're an anthropologist you know about the glorious diversity of humanity and that will help remind you that there is nothing fixed about the way we live if you've graduated in film studies or from the royal conservatory of scotland you appreciate the power of the visual arts and music to convey our human condition and that will show you how creativity and imagination can transform the world if you're a physicist or an astronomer you understand the ways in which various forms of matter and energy interact or you understand the origin of the universe and that knowledge will help you strive for the truth in all that you do each of you will have learned too how to tap into that sweet spot for expressing herself either in an essay or in the classroom or with friends this is the moment when you have confidence in your your words and they seem to come from somewhere true according to what you know so let us celebrate then what you have learned here in saint andrews and thank those who have been partied your experience from an anthropological point of view we are deep in the ritual of graduation names have been called forth graduates have lowered themselves in front of the esteemed head of the institution dressed in their own imposing robes the boredom has touched each person 's head passing down physically the conferral of a degree only then can the full gown and colours be worn as a hood is placed over the head by one of our mace bearers our bedless suitably humbled and appreciative that graduate walks off the stage and rejoins the rest of us slightly dazed and perhaps wondering if they did everything correctly i have seen hundreds of these conferrals over the years and what i find fascinating about watching this ceremony is that each of you enact your parts slightly differently what looks like a controlled homogenizing ritual is in fact bubbling over with individual expression and being all except for the vice chancellor who must confer every degree with precisely the same smile lift to the hand in touch with the berekum the magical of the ritual wouldn't work otherwise all students are equally important in the eyes of the university yet here we are behaving as a single group in this newly refurbished space the feeling of community is filling us all with joy for the french sociologist emile durkheim this sense of togetherness is so strong it leads to an effervescent whole that is greater than the sum of the parts that he defines as society the victor turner the scottish born anthropologist we are now in the middle part of the three stage ritual process each graduate will emerge differently your status changed your inner being impressed with the power of the institution to effect that transformation you will never be the same again following that pat on the head by that old threadbare cloth you can all now go out into the world refreshed and with more authority in the eyes of society so respect while there's much to commend these venerable interpretations of ritual what do you really make of this ceremony as you hear my words and tune into the changes you're experiencing i would say that's what's what is lost here is your personality and your own path to get to this point the trials and trails of learning you have undergone and you can now look back on with such pride this moment is a chance to reflect on your own personal route to graduation each one of you has a fascinating story to tell this narrative of learning and we have to include learning too will follow you beyond this moment it will inhabit your own gestures and understanding to that extent your time here at the university will be a growing and moving part of your life your path will continue as i leave this building and you will take something of saint andrews with you this then is also the time to realize the immense authority and responsibility in your hands the institution has given you a degree in recognition of your talent but do not be followed fooled by the ritual you give the institution its power and value not vice versa similarly do not let society define you you should aim to define society with the values and virtues you would like it to have what matters is a world out there not in here so continue with your labours of learning and playing go on the adventurers journeys these labours promise having gone through the last two pandemic years you're the best prepared group of students to face this tough world and to bring compassion and empathy to the way we treat each other to bring experiential truth and personal meaning to institutional power and ritual you are riding the wave of your lives to the future your privilege is to have choices as you surf that wave make yours wisely and make them part of your adventure nurturing that sweet spot of truth only you know please do keep in touch with your one time teachers i can sincerely say that nothing gives more pleasure to my colleagues than to hear from someone they taught in how they are doing even in hard times we hold dear those relationships we will not forget you so let me end by thanking you for making saint andrews a wonderful place it is we all wish you and your loved ones health and happiness it has been an immense pleasure to accompany your progress and see you all now graduate in such style please stand for the benediction gracia dominos three yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritual sanctity

july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proven resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors all this however not only a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the 12th century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in 1318 university instruction commenced here in may 1410 when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict 13 issued papal bulls from peniscola in august 1413 which were met by great jubilation when carried into the town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king robert the 3rd and later as a tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for 18 years king james revisited st andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas here in 1425 and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the 6th of scotland and 1st of england visited st andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in 1643 on south st this was a key moment for the early library well one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary's college from 1580 and as rector from 1590 melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lucky of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in 2005 we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may 2021 our institutional museum the ward law recently redeveloped and situated on the schools will from today onwards display one of the three 40th birthday portraits of the duchess of cambridge a venue selected by the duchess in partnership with the national portrait gallery in recognition of the influence of saint andrews upon her life the portrait and the ward law more broadly are well worth a visit during your time here in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and change makers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of 5th to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make here from here is yours to envisage but their example is 1 from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connectors to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed a st salvator's chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say it superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from the saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete since our theaters chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor terrence cave to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor mark harris from the school of philosophical anthropological and film studies the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but are taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrew throughout your life decanus faculty artis artsiom vice chancellor i have the honor to present for the degree

figure in french and literary studies who has been influencing our understanding of literature for almost 60 years in this country and around the world his professional story began here at saint andrews as an assistant lecturer in french shortly after completing his studies at the university of cambridge he then moved to warwick university before settling in 1972 at oxford university as a fellow and tutor at saint john's college he became university professor of french there in 1989 and has been professor and fellow emeritus since 2001 during his long teaching career professor cave was to challenge inspire and by all accounts and in the nicest possible way thoroughly intimidate hundreds of students who like his colleagues praise his dedication humility and kindness as well as his tremendous intellect while he became known primarily for his contributions to french renaissance studies with books entitled the cornucopian text problems of writing in the french renaissance in 1979 and pistoia volumes one and two in 1999 and 2001 professor cave has also written on aristotelian poetics in recognitions in 1988 and on the relations between literature and music menials afterlives 2011 his insights always transferred easily to the contemporary and other contexts but this became even more apparent after he was awarded the prestigious balzan prize in 2009 and directed the groundbreaking project literature as an object of knowledge this positioned literary texts as unique works of human cognition and drew accordingly on methodologies from cognitive psychology neuroscience and philosophy amongst others to explore new approaches to literary criticism the books thinking with literature 2016 reading beyond the code 2018 and live artifacts 2022 are among the outcomes of that project this considerable corpus is consistently interested in precisely problems of writing the purpose and uses of literature the ways in which we read and write and reread and rewrite from one age culture mode of inquiry thought or expression to another are some of the infinitely complex questions that professor cave tirelessly addresses his expertise encompasses every genre and ranges from habler pulsar and montagne to shakespeare gerter elliott conrad and angela carter his style is limpid and elegant but also warm amusing and frankly thrilling in that his reader invariably finds herself impatient to know what happens next how one idea will lead to another and what the conclusion will be professors caves is a body of work of outstanding importance that has altered approaches to literature across languages and generations and perhaps uniquely it has made generations of readers really smile as they studied it vice chancellor in recognition of his major

couriers ray in symbolum superette hope bradham imponent congratulation vice chancellor laureata fellow grudge rounds colleagues students families and friends i hardly need to say that i'm deeply grateful to the university of saint andrews and its officers for choosing to confer on me this extraordinary honour more personally i'd like to offer my warmest thanks to the vice chancellor professor sally mapstone for presiding over this process and for hosting us me and my wife in great luxury in her beautiful house on the scores i'm deeply grateful to professor lorna milne the large data for taking on the job this obvious job arduous job and i'm both moved and humbled by the generous account she gave of my career through professor miller i'd like also to express my gratitude to the french department at saint andrews who presumably played a crucial role in the nomination process fiona thompson the executive officer to the principal's office guided me expertly through all the administrative requirements and made detailed arrangements on the ground and i want to take this opportunity to offer her too my sincerest thanks so now a brief word to you my fellow graduands it's a great privilege for me to share this event with you and to be present at such a critical moment in your lives i'm at the other end of that trajectory it's in fact exactly 60 years since i came to saint andrews for my first proper academic job in 1962 so in a sense it's my diamond jubilee jubilee i've got a long way to go to catch up with the queen but i'm working on it i can clearly recall arriving 1 autumn day that year 1962 and finding the bunk i've been assigned to in a tall stone building on murray park i had a room at the top of the house and from there at night i could hear the sound of the sea breaking on the rocks below the scores i fell in love with the place straight away and had three wonderful years here and my other things i learned a great deal about teaching i could go into that in more detail but it would take too long the memory of my time in saint andrews has remained with me ever since refreshed by occasional trips as an external examiner or a guest lecturer and it's an absolute delight to come back on this occasion most of you will go on to have very different lives from mine and i hope they'll be happy and successful ones but the one thing you and i all share regardless of the years that separate us is the experience of spending a key part of our earlier lives in this place so if i have a message for you it would simply be this you've had the opportunity and the privilege to study at world class university in an incomparably beautiful setting let that memory become and remain a part of your future life whatever career you may be thinking of it will enrich you and give you values to take with you wherever you go and i'll conclude on a more serious note by echoing the words of ringo starr i saw recently on the BBC website that he'd been given an honorary doctorate by an academy of music in boston and they transcribed his acceptance speech which ran as follows i just want to say thank you and peace and love i can't do better than that peace and love i call upon professor mark harris of the school of philosophical anthropological and film studies vice chancellor's colleagues graduates and special guests heartfelt congratulations to each graduate if you're a philosopher you will now be able to make a truly logical argument that only the best minds will beat that will stand you in very good stead for the rest of your life if you're an anthropologist you know about the glorious diversity of humanity and that will help remind you that there is nothing fixed about the way we live if you've graduated in film studies or from the royal conservatory of scotland you appreciate the power of the visual arts and music to convey our human condition and that will show you how creativity and imagination can transform the world if you're a physicist or an astronomer you understand the ways in which various forms of matter and energy interact or you understand the origin of the universe and that knowledge will help you strive for the truth in all that you do each of you will have learned too how to tap into that sweet spot for expressing herself either in an essay or in the classroom or with friends this is the moment when you have confidence in your your words and they seem to come from somewhere true according to what you know so let us celebrate then what you have learned here in saint andrews and thank those who have been partied your experience from an anthropological point of view we are deep in the ritual of graduation names have been called forth graduates have lowered themselves in front of the esteemed head of the institution dressed in their own imposing robes the boredom has touched each person's head passing down physically the conferral of a degree only then can the full gown and colours be worn as a hood is placed over the head by one of our mace bearers our bedless suitably humbled and appreciative that graduate walks off the stage and rejoins the rest of us slightly dazed and perhaps wondering if they did everything correctly i have seen hundreds of these conferrals over the years and what i find fascinating about watching this ceremony is that each of you enact your parts slightly differently what looks like a controlled homogenizing ritual is in fact bubbling over with individual expression and being all except for the vice chancellor who must confer every degree with precisely the same smile lift to the hand in touch with the berekum the magical of the ritual wouldn't work otherwise all students are equally important in the eyes of the university yet here we are behaving as a single group in this newly refurbished space the feeling of community is filling us all with joy for the french sociologist emile durkheim this sense of togetherness is so strong it leads to an effervescent whole that is greater than the sum of the parts that he defines as society the victor turner the scottish born anthropologist we are now in the middle part of the three stage ritual process each graduate will emerge differently your status changed your inner being impressed with the power of the institution to effect that transformation you will never be the same again following that pat on the head by that old threadbare cloth you can all now go out into the world refreshed and with more authority in the eyes of society so respect while there's much to commend these venerable interpretations of ritual what do you really make of this ceremony as you hear my words and tune into the changes you're experiencing i would say that's what's what is lost here is your personality and your own path to get to this point the trials and trails of learning you have undergone and you can now look back on with such pride this moment is a chance to reflect on your own personal route to graduation each one of you has a fascinating story to tell this narrative of learning and we have to include learning too will follow you beyond this moment it will inhabit your own gestures and understanding to that extent your time here at the university will be a growing and moving part of your life your path will continue as i leave this building and you will take something of saint andrews with you this then is also the time to realize the immense authority and responsibility in your hands the institution has given you a degree in recognition of your talent but do not be followed fooled by the ritual you give the institution its power and value not vice versa similarly do not let society define you you should aim to define society with the values and virtues you would like it to have what matters is a world out there not in here so continue with your labours of learning and playing go on the adventurers journeys these labours promise having gone through the last two pandemic years you're the best prepared group of students to face this tough world and to bring compassion and empathy to the way we treat each other to bring experiential truth and personal meaning to institutional power and ritual you are riding the wave of your lives to the future your privilege is to have choices as you surf that wave make yours wisely and make them part of your adventure nurturing that sweet spot of truth only you know please do keep in touch with your one time teachers i can sincerely say that nothing gives more pleasure to my colleagues than to hear from someone they taught in how they are doing even in hard times we hold dear those relationships we will not forget you so let me end by thanking you for making saint andrews a wonderful place it is we all wish you and your loved ones health and happiness it has been an immense pleasure to accompany your progress and see you all now graduate in such style please stand for the benediction gracia

Please be seated. Good afternoon everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the Young hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Today's graduates will cross. The younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proven resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. All this, however, not only a story of survival, but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural and intellectual development since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland senior Bishop, and consecrated. Upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town. And university status was formalised when Pope Benedict, 13, issued papal bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into the town the following February. The royal leaders of Scotland and later the United Kingdom have been a guiding, enriching and at times challenging presence in our history. Saint Andrews was the spiritual home of Scotland and on occasion hosted the Scottish Court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the Royal household. Our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, served as an adviser and diplomat to King Robert the 3rd and later as a tutor and protector to his son, the future King James, the first of Scotland, who resided with him in Saint Andrews Castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to France, which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in England for 18 years. King James Revisited St. Andrews throughout his life celebrating Christmas here in 1425 and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to Perth. His request was dutifully and happily ignored. Our university library, the oldest continuous library in Scotland, is indebted to royal patronage. King James, the 6th of Scotland and 1st of England visited St. Andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the University Library. A building in his honour to accommodate this collection, the King James Library was completed in 1643 on South St. This was a key moment for the early library. Well, one suspects that King James was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign. King James clashed repeatedly with Andrew Melville, a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as Principal of Saint Mary's College from 1580 and as rector from 1590. Melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university, but was resistant to royal interference. Given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether, King James locked Melville in the Tower of London. Royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lucky of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence. We enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating Her Majesty the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. We have been honoured by the presence of Her Majesty periodically throughout her reign, most recently at the graduation of our alumni, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in 2005. We were delighted to welcome their Royal Highnesses back to the university for a visit in May 2021. Our institutional museum. The Ward law recently redeveloped and situated on the schools, will from today onwards display one of the three 40th birthday portraits of the Duchess of Cambridge, a venue selected by the Duchess in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery. In recognition of the influence of Saint Andrews upon her life. The portrait and the Ward law more broadly are well worth a visit during your time here. In crossing today's stage, each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps, but also in the footsteps of the academics, leaders and change makers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of 5th to shape the world in profound ways. The journey you make here from here is yours to envisage, but their example is 1, from which we can all draw inspiration. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals, which connectors to our forebears. The first of these you have already witnessed. A St Salvator's Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor. Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and I will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap. To most though, I will simply say it superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from the Saint Andrews Tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, since our theaters Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Professor Terrence cave. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates. Wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is professor Mark Harris from the School of Philosophical, Anthropological and Film Studies. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So while you were graduating, you are not leaving our community, but are taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a Saint Andrew. Throughout your life. Decanus faculty Artis artsiom.

I call upon the master of the United College and Deputy principal Professor, Lorna Mill. Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa Professor Terence Cave. Professor Terence Cave, CBE FB a Chevalier Donald, or national Demeritte, is a leading figure in French and literary studies who has been influencing our understanding of literature for almost 60 years in this country and around the world. His professional story began here at Saint Andrews as an assistant lecturer in French shortly after completing his studies at the University of Cambridge. He then moved to Warwick University before settling in 1972 at Oxford University as a fellow and tutor at Saint John's College. He became university professor of French there in 1989 and has been professor and fellow emeritus since 2001. During his long teaching career, Professor Cave was to challenge, inspire, and by all accounts, and in the nicest possible way, thoroughly intimidate hundreds of students. Who like his colleagues praise his dedication, humility and kindness as well as his tremendous intellect. While he became known primarily for his contributions to French Renaissance studies, with books entitled The Cornucopian text, problems of writing in the French Renaissance in 1979 and Pistoia volumes one and two in 1999 and 2001, Professor Cave has also written on Aristotelian poetics in recognitions in 1988 and on the relations between literature and music. Menials afterlives. 2011 his insights always transferred easily to the contemporary and other contexts, but this became even more apparent after he was awarded the prestigious Balzan Prize in 2009 and directed the groundbreaking project literature as an object of knowledge. This positioned literary texts as unique works of human cognition and drew accordingly on methodologies from cognitive psychology, neuroscience and philosophy amongst others, to explore new approaches to literary criticism. The books thinking with literature 2016 reading beyond the code 2018 and live artifacts 2022 are among the outcomes of that project. This considerable corpus is consistently interested in precisely problems of writing. The purpose and uses of literature the ways in which we read and write and reread and rewrite from one age culture mode of inquiry, thought or expression to another, are some of the infinitely complex questions that Professor Cave tirelessly addresses. His expertise encompasses every genre and ranges from Habler, Pulsar and Montagne to Shakespeare, gerter, Elliott Conrad and Angela Carter. His style is limpid and elegant, but also warm, amusing, and frankly thrilling in that his reader invariably finds herself impatient to know what happens next. How one idea will lead to another, and what the conclusion will be. Professors Caves is a body of work of outstanding importance that has altered approaches to literature across languages and generations, and perhaps uniquely. It has made generations of readers really smile as they studied it. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to French and literary studies, I ask you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters on ORESKO USA on Professor Terence Cave. Tea at Gradam Doctoris Litteram honoris causa promouvoir couriers ray in symbolum superette. Hope Bradham, imponent. Congratulation Vice chancellor laureata. Fellow grudge rounds, colleagues, students, families and friends. I hardly need to say that I'm deeply grateful to the University of Saint Andrews. And its officers. For choosing to confer on me this extraordinary honour. More personally, I'd like to offer my warmest thanks to the Vice Chancellor Professor Sally Mapstone. For presiding over this process. And for hosting us, me and my wife in great luxury in her beautiful house on the scores. I'm deeply grateful to. Professor Lorna Milne. The large data. For taking on the job, this obvious job, arduous job and I'm both moved and humbled by the generous account she gave of my career. Through Professor Miller, I'd like also to express my gratitude to the French department at Saint Andrews. Who presumably played a crucial role in the nomination process. Fiona Thompson, the executive officer to the principal's office, guided me expertly through all the administrative requirements and made detailed arrangements on the ground. And I want to take this opportunity to offer her too my sincerest thanks. So now a brief word to you, my fellow graduands. It's a great privilege for me to share this event with you and to be present at such a critical moment in your lives. I'm at the other end of that trajectory. It's in fact exactly 60 years since I came to Saint Andrews for my first proper academic job in 1962. So in a sense, it's my Diamond Jubilee Jubilee. I've got a long way to go to catch up with the queen, but I'm working on it. I can clearly recall arriving 1 autumn day that year 1962 and finding the bunk I've been assigned to in a tall stone building on Murray Park. I had a room at the top of the house and from there at night I could hear the sound of the sea breaking on the rocks below the scores. I fell in love with the place straight away and had three wonderful years here and my other things. I learned a great deal about teaching. I could go into that in more detail, but it would take too long. The memory of my time in Saint Andrews has remained with me ever since refreshed by occasional trips as an external examiner or a guest lecturer, and it's an absolute delight to come back on this occasion. Most of you will go on to have very different lives from mine, and I hope they'll be happy and successful ones. But the one thing you and I all share, regardless of the years that separate us is the experience of spending a key part of our earlier lives in this place. So if I have a message for you, it would simply be this. You've had the opportunity and the privilege to study at World Class University in an incomparably beautiful setting. Let that memory become and remain a part of your future life. Whatever career you may be thinking of. It will enrich you and give you values to take with you wherever you go. And I'll conclude on a more serious note, by echoing the words of Ringo Starr. I saw recently on the BBC website that he'd been given an honorary doctorate by an Academy of Music in Boston, and they transcribed his acceptance speech, which ran as follows. I just want to say thank you and peace and love. I can't do better than that. Peace and love. I call upon Professor Mark Harris of the School of Philosophical, Anthropological and Film Studies. Vice Chancellor's colleagues, graduates and special guests heartfelt congratulations to each graduate. If you're a philosopher, you will now be able to make a truly logical argument that only the best minds will beat. That will stand you in very good stead for the rest of your life. If you're an anthropologist, you know about the glorious diversity of humanity and that will help remind you that there is nothing fixed about the way we live. If you've graduated in film studies or from the Royal Conservatory of Scotland, you appreciate the power of the visual arts and music to convey our human condition, and that will show you how creativity and imagination can transform the world. If you're a physicist or an astronomer, you understand the ways in which various forms of matter and energy interact, or you understand the origin of the universe and that knowledge will help you strive for the truth in all that you do. Each of you will have learned too how to tap into that sweet spot for expressing herself, either in an essay or in the classroom or with friends. This is the moment when you have confidence in your your words and they seem to come from somewhere true according to what you know. So let us celebrate then what you have learned here in Saint Andrews, and thank those who have been partied. Your experience. From an anthropological point of view, we are deep in the ritual of graduation. Names have been called forth. Graduates have lowered themselves in front of the esteemed head of the institution dressed in their own imposing robes. The boredom has touched each person's head passing down physically, the conferral of a degree. Only then can the full gown and colours be worn as a hood is placed over the head by one of our Mace bearers, our bedless. Suitably humbled and appreciative that graduate walks off the stage and rejoins the rest of us. Slightly dazed and perhaps wondering if they did everything correctly. I have seen hundreds of these conferrals over the years and what I find fascinating about watching this ceremony is that each of you enact your parts slightly differently. What looks like a controlled homogenizing ritual is in fact bubbling over with individual expression and being all except for the Vice Chancellor, who must confer every degree with precisely the same smile lift to the hand in touch with the berekum, the magical of the ritual wouldn't work otherwise. All students are equally important in the eyes of the university. Yet here we are behaving as a single group in this newly refurbished space. The feeling of community is filling us all with joy. For the French sociologist Emile Durkheim, this sense of togetherness is so strong it leads to an effervescent whole that is greater than the sum of the parts that he defines as society. The Victor Turner the Scottish born anthropologist. We are now in the middle part of the three stage ritual process. Each graduate will emerge differently. Your status changed, your inner being impressed with the power of the institution to effect that transformation, you will never be the same again following that, pat on the head by that old threadbare cloth. You can all now go out into the world refreshed and with more authority in the eyes of society. So respect. While there's much to commend these venerable interpretations of ritual, what do you really make of this ceremony? As you hear my words and tune into the changes you're experiencing? I would say that's what's what is lost here is your personality and your own path to get to this point. The trials and trails of learning you have undergone and you can now look back on with such pride. This moment is a chance to reflect on your own personal route to graduation. Each one of you has a fascinating story to tell. This narrative of learning and we have to include learning too. Will follow you beyond this moment. It will inhabit your own gestures and understanding. To that extent. Your time here at the university will be a growing and moving part of your life. Your path will continue as I leave this building and you will take something of Saint Andrews with you. This then is also the time to realize the immense authority and responsibility in your hands. The institution has given you a degree in recognition of your talent, but do not be followed. Fooled by the ritual you give the institution its power and value, not vice versa. Similarly, do not let society define you. You should aim to define society with the values and virtues you would like it to have. What matters is a world out there, not in here. So continue with your labours of learning and playing. Go on the adventurers journeys. These labours promise, having gone through the last two pandemic years, you're the best prepared group of students to face this tough world and to bring compassion and empathy to the way we treat each other. To bring experiential truth and personal meaning to institutional power and ritual. You are riding the wave of your lives to the future. Your privilege is to have choices as you surf that wave. Make yours wisely and make them part of your adventure. Nurturing that sweet spot of truth only you know. Please do keep in touch with your one time teachers. I can sincerely say that nothing gives more pleasure to my colleagues than to hear from someone they taught in how they are doing. Even in hard times we hold dear those relationships, we will not forget you. So let me end by thanking you for making Saint Andrews a wonderful place. It is, we all wish you and your loved ones health and happiness. It has been an immense pleasure to accompany your progress and see you all. Now graduate in such style. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domino's 3 Yesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio spiritual sanctity. Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular Orum Ahmed."
