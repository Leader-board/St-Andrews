good afternoon everyone it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and love bonds in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the universities foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university construction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status were formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of fifteenth century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history scotty chronicon which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that saint rule was born in circa three hundred AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited one evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint rue brought the relics which constituted one tooth one kneecap one humorous and saint andrews right hand to what bauer describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation 's patron saint the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued saint andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its six hundred years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the fifteenth century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in fourteen seventy nine and fourteen ninety four respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas 's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar 's poetry was among the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in fifteen oh eight and douglas was the first translator of virgil latin and eid into scots completing this in fifteen thirteen these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of saint leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the sixth of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in fifteen sixty five later generations were equally influential the first major printed and foggy of scottish latin poetry delici potaro amscot torum was sponsored by a graduate and early philanthropist of our university john scott in sixteen thirty seven and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from seventeen sixty five to seventeen sixty eight and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by william mure an early female graduate of our university in nineteen ten who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as hermann broch and franz kafka the literary culture that the meier's perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today hosts some of the world 's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our vatas chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all after which the presentation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at super tay 's meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate and this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduands into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete since our vators chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor anne phoenix to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor lorna milne deputy principal and master of the united college the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so while you are graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life the kindness faculty

the degree of doctor of letters on orius cowser professor ann phoenix professor phoenix is professor of psychosocial studies at university college london to say that her achievements are outstanding would be an understatement we simply run out of supervisors describe them professor phoenix is fellow of the british academy a fellow of the academy of social sciences and a fellow of the royal society of arts she is internationally recognised and always honorary doctorates from the universities of linkshare pink in sweden roskilde in denmark and temporary in finland professor phoenix has over two hundred publications and over fourteen thousand citations she has how several highly competitive research grants from the economic and social research council including its prestigious professorial fellowship and obtained funding from the EU and nuffield trust she was one of the first black female professors in the UK and a trailblazer for black and minority ethnic academics who have come after her in two thousand and nineteen she was one of just twenty five black female professors in the UK which highlights one of the most shocking features of british academia more recently she was a member of the behavioural advisory group that informed independence age a group of scientists that published independent advice for the government during the covid nineteen pandemic graduates perhaps most importantly on such a auspicious day when you celebrate your graduation professor phoenix has one very significant thing in common with all of you she too graduated from the university of saint andrews in psychology in nineteen seventy eight so in many respects she knows what it is like to be where you are and to be graduating from this university born in saint vincent in the caribbean in nineteen fifty five professor phoenix joined her parents in london in nineteen sixty one as part of the windrush generation even at a young age she excelled at school and was seen to be academically gifted and exceptional she attended haberdashers ask grammar school in new cross london and flourished after finishing school she did not go straight to university and decided to work instead but after a year of work in which in her own words she found to be so boring she decided to go to university she was encouraged to go by school teachers and a major brian hordle who acted as a mentor when she left school he was her first boss as it who as his title may suggest was certainly a man of his time and who today would be considered to have very outdated views about women and immigrants despite these views he recognised the brilliance of the young person working for him and was instrumental in encouraging professor phoenix to go on to higher education she was the first member of her broader family to do so encouraged by a school teacher who had graduated from saint andrews professor phoenix decided to apply to study psychology here she had never travelled to scotland and at the time the train journey used to take eight hours from london to lucas some things don't seem to change do they for much of our undergraduate degree professor phoenix was the only black student at the university towards the end of her studies there was another black woman and a black man and some asian students but they were very few and far between it was a time when overt forms of racism were rife and considered acceptable amongst polite society even in sleepy gentile saint andrews when professor phoenix was elected as class representative in psychology she received poison pen letters because of her race to some it was simply unconscionable that someone like her could hold a position that represented them but this was but she wasn't fazed by this and continued to excel in his studies indeed professor phoenix has many fond memories of her time at saint andrews the staff were young and dynamic she cherished what she describes as a fantastic education that was to be prized she also met students who were brilliant academically gifted and who helped her critical thinking as i have mentioned professor phoenix academic career is simply outstanding although at times easily overlooked much of this is down to her own commitment to her intellectual craft and sheer dedication and hard work she is internationally renowned expert in psychosocial development her research interests include motherhood social identities young people racialization and gender their minister epistemologies and methodologies inform her research agenda professor phoenix was researching and publishing on intersectionality well before it became part of the current zeitgeist in the academy this is particularly important because at the time many editors discouraged her from using the word intersectionality and suggested that she remove it from her work sixteen years ago reflecting on the complex interplay between the theoretical and practical implications of the concept of intersectionality professor phoenix and her colleague professor pamela pattanama observed long before the term intersectionality was coined in nineteen eighty nine by kimberly crenshaw the concept it denotes had been employed in feminist work on how women are simultaneously positioned as women and for example as black working class lesbian or colonial subjects as such it foregrounds richer and more complex ontology than approaches that attempt to reduce people to one category at a time it also points to the need for multiplex epistemologies in particular it indicates that fruitful knowledge production must treats social positions as a relational intersectionality is thus a handicap dual phrase that aims to make visible the multiple positions that constitute everyday life and the power of relations that are central to it they went on to conclude about the imperfect ability of all concepts the need to continuously interrogate our intellectual tools including the concept of intersectionality itself many academics and practitioners using the concept today overlook this very important cautionary observation for those of us who know her whenever you mention professor phoenix indeed as i did when i told close friends and colleagues about today's orientation without hesitation they always remark about her integrity erudition humility infectious love and perhaps most importantly her kindness i have been fortunate enough to have experienced this generosity of spirit and kindness to equally it is important to recognise that all of this is buttressed by a steely determination as well chancellor in recognition of her major contributions to psychosocial studies and feminist epistemologies and methodologies i invite to invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters on honorius kawser on professor ann phoenix today i'd gradum doctor's litteram on norris koza promotio curious ready in symbolum separate component congratulation well it's an understatement to say that i'm delighted to receive this honorary doctorate and particularly since i myself was an undergraduate as doctor sangra has already explained to you i'd like to thank doctor sangra for taking the time and trouble to prepare such a thoughtful loation i think you can see i never expected him to read any of my work in order to do it but clearly he did but i'm also proud and moved to have seen you the graduands get the degrees you've earned i add my congratulations to the many you will already have received yours is a particularly remarkable achievement since much of the work that you've done for your degree thankfully not all but much was marked by covid nineteen and certainly not what you might have expected so congratulations for that what i learned from my lecturers and peers at saint andrews has been foundational for all my achievements i have no doubt that you too will find that what you have learned here your way of looking at the world and the people you've met will all be invaluable in your everyday lives and in your future careers saint andrews continues to be an excellent university with lecturers who are forging new ways of thinking about their disciplines that's invaluable but as doctor sangara also intimated i actually hope that my presence here also marks some change not away from excellence but as a mark of change i hope that if i were the class representative today that i wouldn't get letters making clear to me that black people had no place to be class representatives or asking who i thought i was i also am sure that if i went to a lecturer as i did then and explained this that they wouldn't say it was irrelevant and immaterial and i should just forget about it so i hope that this is also changed and i think that's really important dynamism and keeping the very best of the degrees here well it's trite to say but today really does symbolically mark the rest of your lives and i would like to encourage you to take the opportunity to think not only about your future employment and your relationships but about how you want to live my wish for you is that throughout your lives you keep in mind three hours and i don't mean that you're likely to forget reading writing and arithmetic no what i mean is relationality rest and relaxation and rectitude those three first of all relationality because people are central to our health happiness and progress it matters how we treat people and how we react to how they treat us we certainly need both people that we can call on when we need them and a much wider circle of friendly acquaintances one can only have that by maintaining good relations with a range of different people there are certainly four people in the world today that even if i haven't spoken to for a year i could phone now from saint andrews from my time at saint andrews so long ago nineteen seventy eight and who would be there for me so it really matters there are also peers who have got into academia and other things that i can have friendly relations with discuss ideas with if need be i can't stress enough how keeping your peer group going is important to you so that's the first thing second rest and relaxation because work exercise and playing hard will never be enough in themselves to rejuvenate you we all need time to relax as much as it's possible within our circumstances and it can be very difficult to do so and perhaps if some people heard me saying that they would think i was completely hypocritical but i really think that it's crucially important and that if one just works or does other things all the time that sometimes that that one is in danger of burning out so regular building into your diary periods of rest and relaxation i would hope that you would be better than i have been at doing that over your lifetime and third rectitude it sounds a very old fashioned word but i think that if you're to like yourself over the next sixty or seventy years you need to maintain your integrity and doctor sangra mentioned integrity i don't mean that you should rigidly stick to one or two principles it's not for example that you will never tell a lie if you say that you won't you're lying because everybody lies and sometimes even if we valorize and really highly value honesty lying can sometimes be the most moral thing to do i i don't mean that that excuses all sorts of life please don't go away and tell people you know there was professor phoenix and what she told us is that we should practice lying no it's not quite what i meant but what i do mean is that we need to understand our own system of moral values and stick to them as much as is possible over time it's really important and i hope that those values for all of you will include social justice but the main thing that i want to say to all of you is many congratulations to you and to all those who've supported you over the years of your degree and that includes academic staff administrative staff people in the canteen as well as crucially your family friends and others who who have supported you i wish you the very best for your future careers and for the lives that you want to live thank you i call upon the master of the united college and deputy principal professor lorna milne chancellor 's principal friends colleagues and especially new graduates warmest congratulations to you it's a delight to celebrate here together with you on this important day of your lives the last time many of us certainly the undergraduates at the time were together in this place was probably at nine or ten o'clock on your first ever monday of university at the opening ceremony for new students do you remember that we here on the stage where sadistically enjoying the cruelty of timetabling a gathering so early on your first monday morning you were nervously eyeing each other and thinking how will it ever get along with all these strangers and not suspecting that the strangers were looking at you and thinking you were pretty strange too well today there are far fewer strangers in the room but these people that you now know so well are not the same as they were on that first monday nobody here is because not only has the world altered around us and it has very powerfully especially in these last two years but education and especially higher education is all about change and it always has been now some people don't agree with this and of course it's easy or lazy to characterize any institution especially one with prominent traditions as we have as stuck in the past you know the old question probably that goes how many saint andrews professors does it take to change a light bulb to which the answer is change in fact the scholars that you see here before you on the stage live for change is our reason that our very vocation is to shake and reform the paradigms that people use to decode the universe and to pass that calling on to you through your studies you've of course acquired an understanding of your subjects but you also now have a perspective on the wider world that was built partly upon the work of this academic community which in turn is inflicted by the intellectual pioneers who came before us as well as those with whom we're in touch all around the world now i'm well qualified to speak with authority on this point because as you can see with your own eyes and as i've just confirmed by my reference to a light bulb joke i am quite old in fact to underline this point more forcefully i shall inform you for future reference that the correct answer to any light bulb changing question is that it takes fifty one one to swap the bulb and fifty to do this and switch it on because many hands make light work which was very funny quite a few years ago so having a established my advanced seniority let me say that by the time i sat exactly where you're sitting at my graduation ceremony forty years ago i had learned not only that budler composed beautiful poetry camuru wrote fascinating novels and mullier penned some of the least funny comic plays in human history but also that everything we read if we do it open mindedly and analytically helps us to reframe the way that we see the entire world even more pertinently to me at the time i found female writers who could entirely revise how we thought about gender equality and difference when i came back here as a lecturer in the nineteen nineties i witnessed the students who took my courses go through the same type of radical revelations in relation to decolonization and ethnicity through the postcolonial literature we studied together now today all these years later the concepts that seemed so revolutionary to me or my students are relatively commonplace for many young people new critical perspectives on sex gender race and empire have changed into established ones and are part of public consciousness now i have absolutely no wish to overstate the academy 's role in changes like this and i certainly don't feel complacent as if our work we're all done it emphatically is not my point is simply that universities have helped to alter our thinking and change society social scientists like professor phoenix are honorary graduate and her laureato doctor sangara as you heard have made brilliant contributions to these developments and so have researchers teachers and students of languages literature psychology science neuroscience film philosophy and so on and so on all of whom ensure that universities play a systematic role in social change every one of you is a significant part of that system and when you look back you'll realize you saw progress developing first hand right here graduates i'm delighted for your success and i can see you're understandably basking in the satisfaction of believing your intellectual toils are over how wrong you could be this is saint andrews i am a professor an old one and of course i have homework for you indeed i've got two things to ask of you before you leave us first remember how you've changed here and keep on doing it use what you've learned to keep your brain your knowledge your opinions and your judgments moving and stay hungry to develop for the rest of your life and second please stand up for universities there are some in our society who fear and dislike change many of whom seem to believe that universities should exist only to pass on static information and enable safe discoveries those people feel threatened by our capacity to foster new ideas with a social cultural or political dynamic and they'd like us to stop well we aren't going to and we hope you won't either i hope when someone asks what university was like for you you'll tell them it was fabulous i had to keep changing my mind from first to last it's one long series of light bulb moments congratulations again all of you and all the very best for your future thank you for being our graduates thank you

good afternoon everyone it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and love bonds in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929 the younger hall closed in july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the universities foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the 12th century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in 1318 university construction commenced here in may 1410 when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status were formalised when pope benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from peniscola in august 1413 which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history scotty chronicon which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that st rule was born in circa 300 AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited 1 evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great st rue brought the relics which constituted one tooth 1 kneecap 1 humorous and saint andrews right hand to what bauer describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation's patron st the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued st andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its 600 years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in 1479 and 1494 respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar's poetry was among the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in 1508 and douglas was the first translator of virgil latin and eid into scots completing this in 1513 these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of st leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the 6th of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in 1565 later generations were equally influential the first major printed and foggy of scottish latin poetry delici potaro amscot torum was sponsored by a graduate and early philanthropist of our university john scott in 1637 and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from 1765 to 1768 and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by william mure an early female graduate of our university in 1910 who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as hermann broch and franz kafka the literary culture that the meier's perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today hosts some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our vatas chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all after which the presentation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition the chancellor will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at super tay's meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate and this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduands into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete since our vators chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor anne phoenix to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor lorna milne deputy principal and master of the united college the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so while you are graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life the kindness faculty artis artium chancellor i have the honor to present for the degree of master of arts general lewis hobbs jeffrey aim of center

cowser professor ann phoenix professor phoenix is professor of psychosocial studies at university college london to say that her achievements are outstanding would be an understatement we simply run out of supervisors describe them professor phoenix is fellow of the british academy a fellow of the academy of social sciences and a fellow of the royal society of arts she is internationally recognised and always honorary doctorates from the universities of linkshare pink in sweden roskilde in denmark and temporary in finland professor phoenix has over 200 publications and over 14,000 citations she has how several highly competitive research grants from the economic and social research council including its prestigious professorial fellowship and obtained funding from the EU and nuffield trust she was one of the first black female professors in the UK and a trailblazer for black and minority ethnic academics who have come after her in 2019 she was one of just 25 black female professors in the UK which highlights one of the most shocking features of british academia more recently she was a member of the behavioural advisory group that informed independence age a group of scientists that published independent advice for the government during the COVID-19 pandemic graduates perhaps most importantly on such a auspicious day when you celebrate your graduation professor phoenix has one very significant thing in common with all of you she too graduated from the university of saint andrews in psychology in 1978 so in many respects she knows what it is like to be where you are and to be graduating from this university born in saint vincent in the caribbean in 1955 professor phoenix joined her parents in london in 1961 as part of the windrush generation even at a young age she excelled at school and was seen to be academically gifted and exceptional she attended haberdashers ask grammar school in new cross london and flourished after finishing school she did not go straight to university and decided to work instead but after a year of work in which in her own words she found to be so boring she decided to go to university she was encouraged to go by school teachers and a major brian hordle who acted as a mentor when she left school he was her first boss as it who as his title may suggest was certainly a man of his time and who today would be considered to have very outdated views about women and immigrants despite these views he recognised the brilliance of the young person working for him and was instrumental in encouraging professor phoenix to go on to higher education she was the first member of her broader family to do so encouraged by a school teacher who had graduated from saint andrews professor phoenix decided to apply to study psychology here she had never travelled to scotland and at the time the train journey used to take 8 hours from london to lucas some things don't seem to change do they for much of our undergraduate degree professor phoenix was the only black student at the university towards the end of her studies there was another black woman and a black man and some asian students but they were very few and far between it was a time when overt forms of racism were rife and considered acceptable amongst polite society even in sleepy gentile st andrews when professor phoenix was elected as class representative in psychology she received poison pen letters because of her race to some it was simply unconscionable that someone like her could hold a position that represented them but this was but she wasn't fazed by this and continued to excel in his studies indeed professor phoenix has many fond memories of her time at saint andrews the staff were young and dynamic she cherished what she describes as a fantastic education that was to be prized she also met students who were brilliant academically gifted and who helped her critical thinking as i have mentioned professor phoenix academic career is simply outstanding although at times easily overlooked much of this is down to her own commitment to her intellectual craft and sheer dedication and hard work she is internationally renowned expert in psychosocial development her research interests include motherhood social identities young people racialization and gender their minister epistemologies and methodologies inform her research agenda professor phoenix was researching and publishing on intersectionality well before it became part of the current zeitgeist in the academy this is particularly important because at the time many editors discouraged her from using the word intersectionality and suggested that she remove it from her work 16 years ago reflecting on the complex interplay between the theoretical and practical implications of the concept of intersectionality professor phoenix and her colleague professor pamela pattanama observed long before the term intersectionality was coined in 1989 by kimberly crenshaw the concept it denotes had been employed in feminist work on how women are simultaneously positioned as women and for example as black working class lesbian or colonial subjects as such it foregrounds richer and more complex ontology than approaches that attempt to reduce people to one category at a time it also points to the need for multiplex epistemologies in particular it indicates that fruitful knowledge production must treats social positions as a relational intersectionality is thus a handicap dual phrase that aims to make visible the multiple positions that constitute everyday life and the power of relations that are central to it they went on to conclude about the imperfect ability of all concepts the need to continuously interrogate our intellectual tools including the concept of intersectionality itself many academics and practitioners using the concept today overlook this very important cautionary observation for those of us who know her whenever you mention professor phoenix indeed as i did when i told close friends and colleagues about today's orientation without hesitation they always remark about her integrity erudition humility infectious love and perhaps most importantly her kindness i have been fortunate enough to have experienced this generosity of spirit and kindness to equally it is important to recognise that all of this is buttressed by a steely determination as well chancellor in recognition of her major contributions to psychosocial studies and feminist epistemologies and methodologies i invite to invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters on honorius kawser on professor ann phoenix today i'd gradum doctor's litteram on norris koza promotio curious ready in symbolum separate component congratulation well it's an understatement to say that i'm delighted to receive this honorary doctorate and particularly since i myself was an undergraduate as doctor sangra has already explained to you i'd like to thank doctor sangra for taking the time and trouble to prepare such a thoughtful loation i think you can see i never expected him to read any of my work in order to do it but clearly he did but i'm also proud and moved to have seen you the graduands get the degrees you've earned i add my congratulations to the many you will already have received yours is a particularly remarkable achievement since much of the work that you've done for your degree thankfully not all but much was marked by COVID-19 and certainly not what you might have expected so congratulations for that what i learned from my lecturers and peers at saint andrews has been foundational for all my achievements i have no doubt that you too will find that what you have learned here your way of looking at the world and the people you've met will all be invaluable in your everyday lives and in your future careers saint andrews continues to be an excellent university with lecturers who are forging new ways of thinking about their disciplines that's invaluable but as doctor sangara also intimated i actually hope that my presence here also marks some change not away from excellence but as a mark of change i hope that if i were the class representative today that i wouldn't get letters making clear to me that black people had no place to be class representatives or asking who i thought i was i also am sure that if i went to a lecturer as i did then and explained this that they wouldn't say it was irrelevant and immaterial and i should just forget about it so i hope that this is also changed and i think that's really important dynamism and keeping the very best of the degrees here well it's trite to say but today really does symbolically mark the rest of your lives and i would like to encourage you to take the opportunity to think not only about your future employment and your relationships but about how you want to live my wish for you is that throughout your lives you keep in mind 3 hours and i don't mean that you're likely to forget reading writing and arithmetic no what i mean is relationality rest and relaxation and rectitude those three first of all relationality because people are central to our health happiness and progress it matters how we treat people and how we react to how they treat us we certainly need both people that we can call on when we need them and a much wider circle of friendly acquaintances one can only have that by maintaining good relations with a range of different people there are certainly four people in the world today that even if i haven't spoken to for a year i could phone now from saint andrews from my time at saint andrews so long ago 1978 and who would be there for me so it really matters there are also peers who have got into academia and other things that i can have friendly relations with discuss ideas with if need be i can't stress enough how keeping your peer group going is important to you so that's the first thing second rest and relaxation because work exercise and playing hard will never be enough in themselves to rejuvenate you we all need time to relax as much as it's possible within our circumstances and it can be very difficult to do so and perhaps if some people heard me saying that they would think i was completely hypocritical but i really think that it's crucially important and that if one just works or does other things all the time that sometimes that that one is in danger of burning out so regular building into your diary periods of rest and relaxation i would hope that you would be better than i have been at doing that over your lifetime and 3rd rectitude it sounds a very old fashioned word but i think that if you're to like yourself over the next 60 or 70 years you need to maintain your integrity and doctor sangra mentioned integrity i don't mean that you should rigidly stick to one or two principles it's not for example that you will never tell a lie if you say that you won't you're lying because everybody lies and sometimes even if we valorize and really highly value honesty lying can sometimes be the most moral thing to do i i don't mean that that excuses all sorts of life please don't go away and tell people you know there was professor phoenix and what she told us is that we should practice lying no it's not quite what i meant but what i do mean is that we need to understand our own system of moral values and stick to them as much as is possible over time it's really important and i hope that those values for all of you will include social justice but the main thing that i want to say to all of you is many congratulations to you and to all those who've supported you over the years of your degree and that includes academic staff administrative staff people in the canteen as well as crucially your family friends and others who who have supported you i wish you the very best for your future careers and for the lives that you want to live thank you i call upon the master of the united college and deputy principal professor lorna milne chancellor's principal friends colleagues and especially new graduates warmest congratulations to you it's a delight to celebrate here together with you on this important day of your lives the last time many of us certainly the undergraduates at the time were together in this place was probably at 9:00 or 10:00 o'clock on your first ever monday of university at the opening ceremony for new students do you remember that we here on the stage where sadistically enjoying the cruelty of timetabling a gathering so early on your first monday morning you were nervously eyeing each other and thinking how will it ever get along with all these strangers and not suspecting that the strangers were looking at you and thinking you were pretty strange too well today there are far fewer strangers in the room but these people that you now know so well are not the same as they were on that first monday nobody here is because not only has the world altered around us and it has very powerfully especially in these last two years but education and especially higher education is all about change and it always has been now some people don't agree with this and of course it's easy or lazy to characterize any institution especially one with prominent traditions as we have as stuck in the past you know the old question probably that goes how many saint andrews professors does it take to change a light bulb to which the answer is change in fact the scholars that you see here before you on the stage live for change is our reason that our very vocation is to shake and reform the paradigms that people use to decode the universe and to pass that calling on to you through your studies you've of course acquired an understanding of your subjects but you also now have a perspective on the wider world that was built partly upon the work of this academic community which in turn is inflicted by the intellectual pioneers who came before us as well as those with whom we're in touch all around the world now i'm well qualified to speak with authority on this point because as you can see with your own eyes and as i've just confirmed by my reference to a light bulb joke i am quite old in fact to underline this point more forcefully i shall inform you for future reference that the correct answer to any light bulb changing question is that it takes 51 one to swap the bulb and 50 to do this and switch it on because many hands make light work which was very funny quite a few years ago so having a established my advanced seniority let me say that by the time i sat exactly where you're sitting at my graduation ceremony 40 years ago i had learned not only that budler composed beautiful poetry camuru wrote fascinating novels and mullier penned some of the least funny comic plays in human history but also that everything we read if we do it open mindedly and analytically helps us to reframe the way that we see the entire world even more pertinently to me at the time i found female writers who could entirely revise how we thought about gender equality and difference when i came back here as a lecturer in the 1990s i witnessed the students who took my courses go through the same type of radical revelations in relation to decolonization and ethnicity through the postcolonial literature we studied together now today all these years later the concepts that seemed so revolutionary to me or my students are relatively commonplace for many young people new critical perspectives on sex gender race and empire have changed into established ones and are part of public consciousness now i have absolutely no wish to overstate the academy's role in changes like this and i certainly don't feel complacent as if our work we're all done it emphatically is not my point is simply that universities have helped to alter our thinking and change society social scientists like professor phoenix are honorary graduate and her laureato dr sangara as you heard have made brilliant contributions to these developments and so have researchers teachers and students of languages literature psychology science neuroscience film philosophy and so on and so on all of whom ensure that universities play a systematic role in social change every one of you is a significant part of that system and when you look back you'll realize you saw progress developing first hand right here graduates i'm delighted for your success and i can see you're understandably basking in the satisfaction of believing your

I call upon the principle of the university. Good afternoon everyone. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic, it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and love. Bonds in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929, the younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other. To shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural and intellectual development since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the Universities Foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University construction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status were formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. Walter Bauer, a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century Scotland, described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of Scottish History. Scotty Chronicon, which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination. Legend has it that St Rule was born in circa 300 AD and was a Bishop in Patras, Greece, when he was visited 1 evening by an Angel who instructed him to take the bones of Saint Andrew far from the reach of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. St Rue brought the relics which constituted one tooth, 1 kneecap, 1 humorous and Saint Andrews right hand to what Bauer describes as the island situated in the ocean. Beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in Saint Andrews, which have proven so formative for contemporary Scotland, developed with Saint Andrew, later becoming the nation's patron St. The lyrical origins of our town and university imbued St. Andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a Crucible for literary creativity. Throughout its 600 years. Walter Bowers Mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas, who graduated in 1479 and 1494, respectively, and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early Modern Scotland. Dunbar, and Douglas's use of Scots was foundational for much literature that followed. Dunbar's poetry was among the first items printed in Scotland by the Edinburgh Printers, Chapman and Miller in 1508, and Douglas was the first translator of Virgil, Latin and Eid into Scots, completing this in 1513. These were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university, including one who would become Principal of St. Leonards College, George Buchanan. The most significant Latin poet of his time. Buchanan was amongst many occupations, a tutor to Mary, Queen of Scots and later King James, the 6th of Scotland, and he served as a poet at Mary's Court, in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks, including a special Commission for the wedding of Mary to Lord Darnley. In 1565, later generations were equally influential. The first major printed and foggy of Scottish Latin poetry, delici potaro Amscot Torum, was sponsored by a graduate and early philanthropist of our university, John Scott, in 1637. And while we cannot claim to have educated Robert Burns who lived degree less to his end days, Saint Andrews was the academic home of the Scottish poet Robert Ferguson, who studied here from 1765 to 1768 and whom Burns held in higher esteem than all other writers. Literary life thrived in more recent centuries, and literary translation in particular was taken up by William Mure, an early female graduate of our university in 1910, who with her husband Edwin, translated works by such luminaries as Hermann Broch and Franz Kafka. The literary culture that the Meier's perpetuated complemented the research activities of our School of English which today hosts some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners. We are highly distinctive in accommodating poets, dramatists and creatives, including Professor Don Patterson OBE Professor John Burnside, and Professor Zinnie Harris, whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour. Capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Vatas Chapel choir initiated proceedings with the rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all, after which the presentation of degrees by the Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will commence. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony, and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition, the chancellor will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and he will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap. To most though, the Chancellor will simply say at Super Tay's meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate, and this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews Taylor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduands into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, since our Vators Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins, for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Professor Anne phoenix. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates. Wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Professor Lorna Milne, deputy principal and Master of the United College. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So while you are graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life. The kindness faculty Artis artium.

I call upon Doctor Gutherson Sangara of the School of International Relations. Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Letters on Orius Cowser Professor Ann Phoenix. Professor Phoenix is professor of psychosocial studies at University College London. To say that her achievements are outstanding would be an understatement. We simply run out of supervisors, describe them. Professor Phoenix is fellow of the British Academy, a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. She is internationally recognised and always honorary doctorates from the universities of Linkshare, Pink in Sweden, Roskilde in Denmark and temporary in Finland. Professor Phoenix has over 200 publications and over 14,000 citations. She has how several highly competitive research grants from the economic and Social Research Council, including its prestigious professorial fellowship and obtained funding from the EU and Nuffield Trust. She was one of the first black female professors in the UK and a trailblazer for black and minority ethnic academics who have come after her. In 2019, she was one of just 25 black female professors in the UK, which highlights one of the most shocking features of British academia. More recently, she was a member of the Behavioural Advisory Group that informed Independence Age, a group of scientists that published independent advice for the government during the COVID-19 pandemic. Graduates, perhaps most importantly on such a auspicious day, when you celebrate your graduation, Professor Phoenix has one very significant thing in common with all of you. She too graduated from the University of Saint Andrews in psychology in 1978. So in many respects she knows what it is like to be where you are and to be graduating from this university. Born in Saint Vincent in the Caribbean in 1955, Professor Phoenix joined her parents in London in 1961 as part of the Windrush generation. Even at a young age she excelled at school and was seen to be academically gifted and exceptional. She attended Haberdashers Ask Grammar School in New Cross London and flourished. After finishing school, she did not go straight to university and decided to work instead. But after a year of work in which in her own words, she found to be so boring, she decided to go to university. She was encouraged to go by school teachers and a major Brian Hordle, who acted as a mentor when she left school. He was her first boss as it, who as his title may suggest, was certainly a man of his time, and who today would be considered to have very outdated views about women and immigrants. Despite these views, he recognised the brilliance of the young person working for him and was instrumental in encouraging Professor Phoenix to go on to higher education. She was the first member of her broader family to do so. Encouraged by a school teacher who had graduated from Saint Andrews, Professor Phoenix decided to apply to study psychology here. She had never travelled to Scotland, and at the time the train journey used to take 8 hours from London to Lucas. Some things don't seem to change, do they? For much of our undergraduate degree, Professor Phoenix was the only black student at the university towards the end of her studies, there was another black woman and a black man and some Asian students, but they were very few and far between. It was a time when overt forms of racism were rife and considered acceptable amongst polite society, even in sleepy Gentile St. Andrews. When Professor Phoenix was elected as class representative in psychology, she received poison pen letters because of her race. To some, it was simply unconscionable that someone like her could hold a position that represented them. But this was but she wasn't fazed by this and continued to excel in his studies. Indeed, Professor Phoenix has many fond memories of her time at Saint Andrews. The staff were young and dynamic. She cherished what she describes as a fantastic education that was to be prized. She also met students who were brilliant, academically gifted, and who helped her. Critical thinking. As I have mentioned, Professor Phoenix academic career is simply outstanding, although at times easily overlooked. Much of this is down to her own commitment to her intellectual craft and sheer dedication and hard work. She is internationally renowned expert in psychosocial development. Her research interests include motherhood, social identities, young people, racialization, and gender. Their minister, epistemologies and methodologies inform her research agenda. Professor Phoenix was researching and publishing on intersectionality well before it became part of the current zeitgeist in the Academy. This is particularly important because at the time many editors discouraged her from using the word intersectionality and suggested that she remove it from her work. 16 years ago, reflecting on the complex interplay between the theoretical and practical implications of the concept of intersectionality, Professor Phoenix and her colleague, Professor Pamela Pattanama observed. Long before the term intersectionality was coined in 1989 by Kimberly Crenshaw, the concept it denotes had been employed in feminist work on how women are simultaneously positioned as women, and for example, as black working class lesbian or colonial subjects. As such, it foregrounds richer and more complex ontology than approaches that attempt to reduce people to one category at a time. It also points to the need for Multiplex epistemologies. In particular, it indicates that fruitful knowledge production must treats social positions as a relational intersectionality is thus a handicap dual phrase that aims to make visible the multiple positions that constitute everyday life and the power of relations that are central to it. They went on to conclude about the imperfect ability of all concepts, the need to continuously interrogate our intellectual tools, including the concept of intersectionality itself. Many academics and practitioners using the concept today overlook this very important cautionary observation. For those of us who know her, whenever you mention Professor Phoenix, indeed, as I did when I told close friends and colleagues about today's orientation without hesitation, they always remark about her integrity, erudition, humility, infectious love, and, perhaps most importantly, her kindness. I have been fortunate enough to have experienced this generosity of spirit and kindness to equally, it is important to recognise. That all of this is buttressed by a steely determination as well Chancellor in recognition of her major contributions to psychosocial studies and feminist epistemologies and methodologies. I invite to invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters on Honorius Kawser on Professor Ann Phoenix. Today I'd gradum doctor's litteram on Norris Koza Promotio curious, ready in Symbolum separate component. Congratulation well, it's an understatement to say that I'm delighted to receive this honorary doctorate, and particularly since I myself was an undergraduate as Doctor, Sangra has already explained to you, I'd like to thank Doctor Sangra for taking the time. And trouble to prepare such a thoughtful loation. I think you can see I never expected him to read any of my work in order to do it, but clearly he did. But I'm also proud and moved to have seen you the graduands get the degrees you've earned. I add my congratulations to the many you will already have received. Yours is a particularly remarkable achievement, since much of the work that you've done for your degree. Thankfully, not all but much was marked by COVID-19, and certainly not what you might have expected. So congratulations for that. What I learned from my lecturers and peers at Saint Andrews has been foundational for all my achievements. I have no doubt that you too will find that what you have learned here, your way of looking at the world and the people you've met will all be invaluable in your everyday lives and in your future careers. Saint Andrews continues to be an excellent university, with lecturers who are forging new ways of thinking about their disciplines. That's invaluable. But as Doctor Sangara also intimated, I actually hope that my presence here also marks some change not away from excellence but as a mark of change. I hope that if I were the Class representative today, that I wouldn't get letters. Making clear to me that black people had no place to be class representatives or asking who I thought I was. I also am sure that if I went to a lecturer as I did then and explained this that they wouldn't say it was irrelevant and immaterial and I should just forget about it. So I hope that this is also changed and I think that's really important. Dynamism and keeping the very best of the degrees here. Well, it's trite to say. But today really does symbolically mark the rest of your lives. And I would like to encourage you to take the opportunity to think not only about your future employment and your relationships, but about how you want to live. My wish for you is that throughout your lives, you keep in mind 3 hours and I don't mean that you're likely to forget reading, writing and arithmetic. No? What I mean is relationality rest and relaxation and rectitude. Those three first of all relationality, because people are central to our health, happiness and progress. It matters how we treat people and how we react to how they treat us. We certainly need both people that we can call on when we need them, and a much wider circle of friendly acquaintances. One can only have that by maintaining good relations with a range of different people. There are certainly four people in the world today that even if I haven't spoken to for a year, I could phone now from Saint Andrews from my time at Saint Andrews so long ago, 1978, and who would be there for me? So it really matters. There are also peers who have got into academia and other things that I can have friendly relations with, discuss ideas with if need be. I can't stress enough how keeping your peer group going is important to you. So that's the first thing. Second, rest and relaxation. Because work, exercise and playing hard will never be enough in themselves to rejuvenate you. We all need time to relax as much as it's possible within our circumstances, and it can be very difficult to do so, and perhaps if some people heard me saying that they would think I was completely hypocritical, but I really think that it's crucially important, and that if one just works or does other things. All the time that sometimes that that one is in danger of burning out. So regular building into your diary, periods of rest and relaxation. I would hope that you would be better than I have been at doing that over your lifetime, and 3rd rectitude, it sounds a very old fashioned word. But I think that if you're to like yourself over the next 60 or 70 years, you need to maintain your integrity and doctor Sangra mentioned integrity. I don't mean that you should rigidly stick to one or two principles, it's not, for example, that you will never tell a lie if you say that you won't, you're lying because everybody lies, and sometimes even if we valorize and really highly value honesty. Lying can sometimes be the most moral thing to do. I I don't mean that that excuses all sorts of life. Please don't go away and tell people you know there was Professor Phoenix and what she told us is that we should practice lying. No, it's not quite what I meant. But what I do mean is that we need to understand our own system of moral values and stick to them as much as is possible over time. It's really important and I hope that those values for all of you will include social justice. But the main thing that I want to say to all of you is many congratulations to you and to all those who've supported you over the years of your degree, and that includes academic staff, administrative staff, people in the canteen, as well as crucially, your family, friends and others who who have supported you. I wish you the very best for your future careers and for the lives that you want to live. Thank you. I call upon the master of the United College and Deputy principal Professor, Lorna Milne. Chancellor's principal friends, colleagues, and especially new graduates. Warmest congratulations to you. It's a delight to celebrate here together with you on this important day of your lives. The last time many of us, certainly the undergraduates at the time were together in this place was probably at 9:00 or 10:00 o'clock on your first ever Monday of university at the opening ceremony for new students. Do you remember that? We here on the stage where sadistically enjoying the cruelty of timetabling a gathering so early on your first Monday morning. You were nervously eyeing each other and thinking how will it ever get along with all these strangers and not suspecting that the strangers were looking at you and thinking you were pretty strange too? Well today there are far fewer strangers in the room, but these people that you now know so well are not the same as they were on that first Monday. Nobody here is because not only has the world altered around us and it has very powerfully, especially in these last two years. But education, and especially higher education is all about change and it always has been. Now, some people don't agree with this, and of course it's easy or lazy to characterize any institution, especially one with prominent traditions as we have as stuck in the past. You know the old question. Probably that goes how many Saint Andrews professors does it take to change a light bulb? To which the answer is change? In fact, the scholars that you see here before you on the stage live for change is our reason that our very vocation is to shake and reform the paradigms that people use to decode the universe and to pass that calling on to you. Through your studies, you've of course acquired an understanding of your subjects, but you also now have a perspective on the wider world that was built partly upon the work of this academic community, which in turn is inflicted by the intellectual pioneers who came before us, as well as those with whom we're in touch all around the world. Now I'm well qualified to speak with authority on this point, because as you can see with your own eyes, and as I've just confirmed by my reference to a light bulb joke, I am quite old. In fact, to underline this point more forcefully, I shall inform you for future reference that the correct answer to any light bulb changing question is that it takes 51 one to swap the bulb and 50 to do this and switch it on because many hands make light work. Which was very funny. Quite a few years ago, so having a established my advanced seniority, let me say that by the time I sat exactly where you're sitting at my graduation ceremony 40 years ago, I had learned not only that Budler composed beautiful poetry, Camuru wrote fascinating novels, and mullier penned some of the least funny comic plays in human history. But also that everything we read if we do it open mindedly and analytically helps us to reframe the way that we see the entire world. Even more pertinently, to me at the time I found female writers who could entirely revise how we thought about gender equality and difference. When I came back here as a lecturer in the 1990s, I witnessed the students who took my courses go through the same type of radical revelations in relation to decolonization and ethnicity through the postcolonial literature we studied together. Now today all these years later, the concepts that seemed so revolutionary to me or my students are relatively commonplace for many young people. New critical perspectives on sex, gender, race, and empire have changed into established ones and are part of public consciousness. Now, I have absolutely no wish to overstate the academy's role in changes like this, and I certainly don't feel complacent as if our work. We're all done. It emphatically is not. My point is simply that universities have helped to alter our thinking and change society. Social scientists like Professor Phoenix are honorary graduate and her laureato Dr Sangara as you heard, have made brilliant contributions to these developments, and so have researchers, teachers, and students of languages, literature, psychology, science, neuroscience, film, philosophy, and so on, and so on, all of whom ensure that universities play a systematic role in social change. Every one of you is a significant part of that system. And when you look back, you'll realize you saw progress developing first hand right here. Graduates, I'm delighted for your success and I can see you're understandably basking in the satisfaction of believing your intellectual toils are over. How wrong you could be this is Saint Andrews. I am a professor, an old one and of course I have homework for you. Indeed, I've got two things to ask of you before you leave us. First, remember how you've changed here and keep on doing it. Use what you've learned to keep your brain, your knowledge, your opinions, and your judgments. Moving and stay hungry to develop for the rest of your life. And 2nd please stand up for universities. There are some in our society who fear and dislike change, many of whom seem to believe that universities should exist only to pass on static information and enable safe discoveries. Those people feel threatened by our capacity to foster new ideas with a social, cultural, or political dynamic, and they'd like us to stop. Well, we aren't going to, and we hope you won't either. I hope when someone asks what university was like for you, you'll tell them it was fabulous. I had to keep changing my mind from first to last. It's one long series of light bulb moments. Congratulations again. All of you and all the very best for your future. Thank you for being our graduates. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction.
