principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic counter around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were posted online due to the pandemic it is us with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends his teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremony is it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger all closed in july two thousand and nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised the space for the next century of its existence well centering the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations being refreshed intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger all stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observed today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals are our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred nine years students and academics gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors this is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliament since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduate serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learn primarily through lengthy iterations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of the curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation like conducted in latin which made remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of verbal interrogation by one of the professors and the discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both found at the fifteenth century saint andrews as two distracting but artery and an important skill for the defence of the realm was prevented this may have occasioned second force in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and the members of the faculty were set upon by students with those arrows student life incident and college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidence more the statism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started classes at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now it will surprise you on weapons and the college strictly prohibited beers and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly for the biden let's say like football should prove too distracting with the exception of the single laundress and on the condition that she was over fifteen years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time out of ferguson renowned lighting philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson founding father of the united states started here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jumara in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner who's advancements in the prevention of smallpox highly modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds and hundreds have become as described by one contemporary alumnus healthy retired sport in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the universities scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundred student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest implication of this is the university quincentennial centenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred gathered deaths garden parties spread across town speeches were delivered representatives of a hundred and forty five universities and learned societies visited and and a hundred on three degrees withstood a student board place as well as a formal banquet staff gets in developmental group museum and the town came to life song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of a building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes it is therefore sight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudy armus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the cover conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say ET super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or ferratum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduations into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete i shall then make a special presentation of the principles medal an award for academic and extra curricular endeavour to one of our graduates the principal 's medal will today be bestowed bestowed upon george cherry of the school of mathematics and statistics same town theaters chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor sir john bull to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is doctor owen jordan from the international education institute the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduations are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrew and throughout your

renuncio congratulations to all our graduates i should now like to introduce the principal 's medal this award was inaugurated thirteen years ago with a gift from three anonymous donors and is supported by ed and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and rope makers in the world the award of the principal 's medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year twenty twenty one to twenty twenty two the principal 's medal is being awarded to two outstanding students today we recognise george cherry who has just received the degree of master of mathematics with honours george is first and foremost a formidable scholar in the thirteen modules she completed at saint andrews all but one received a first class mark and she graduates as one of the foremost students of her cohort george made the deans list for outstanding academic achievement in each year of study is described by her nominator as an outstanding and typically ambitious student and has further served her school as one of three student maths ambassadors since two thousand and nineteen i'm delighted that george will continue her ambitious theoretical inquiries as a doctoral student at the university of oslo from september onwards such academic attainment is significant in itself but george is a polymath of renaissance proportions combining a huge work ethic with substantial natural talent that enables her to excel at all to which she turns her hand the most prominent of these is music and it is no overstatement to say that george is a student of breathtaking skill george is a university 's foremost student pianist she has been a university piano scholar since the commencement of her studies in two thousand and eighteen and she regularly performs at major university events i've had the pleasure of experiencing this and can attest that georgia 's talents are unforgettable george also held a brass scholarship from twenty twenty to twenty twenty one recognising her additional talent for trumpet playing and these are by no means the only instruments that she has mastered alongside working as a piano tutor at the night piano school in glasgow george is a formidable leader of musical life in our town organising or directing events since her first days in saint andrews during lockdown george musical directed via zoom an adaptation of mamma mia coordinating a sixteen piece band and twenty five person cast over two weeks of quarantine in two thousand and nineteen for no reason other than to sustain a love for performance at a time of separation east covid restrictions have since enabled george to return to in person directing including a production of sweeney todd in saint andrews which she conducted and moves people directed last semester her last project was one of equal accomplishment and ambition a four hour musical performance on four adjacent pianos a simonton holtz canto ostinato delivered by twelve student pianists in the laidlaw music centre which george conceived and directed george is also an accomplished professional photographer and sports person she has competed internationally with oxford city boat club and she was a member of the women 's first rugby team at saint andrews for two years in taking in all of these attainments and her very many others georges nominator concludes that the talent commitment and achievement shown by george only comes around once in a generation and as principal i could not agree more george in recognition of your superlative accomplishments both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal 's medal i call upon professor mark chaplin of the school of mathematics and statistics vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science honoris causa professor sir john mcleod ball john mcleod ball was born in farnham surrey after attending mill hill school in london he obtained his undergraduate degree in mathematics from saint john's college university of cambridge in nineteen sixty nine and is defiled in mechanical engineering in nineteen seventy two from the university of sussex he did his postdoctoral research fellowship at heriot watt university in scotland and at brown university in the united states of america between nineteen seventy four and nineteen ninety six he was at heriot watt university where he became professor of applied analysis and from nineteen ninety six to twenty eighteen he was the sadly and professor of natural philosophy at oxford and the sedley and chair is the oldest of oxford scientific chairs dating back to sixteen twenty one and there he was the director of the oxford centre for nonlinear partial differential equations he is currently professor in the school of mathematical and computer sciences at heriot watt university and also emeritus professor and emeritus fellow of queens college at the university of oxford and senior fellow at the hong kong institute for advanced study city university hong kong and over the years he has held numerous visiting positions in prestigious institutions across the world including the university of california berkeley university paris pierre marie curie in paris university of minnesota the institute for advanced study at princeton and the tata institute for fundamental research in bangalore so john 's research is in the area of applied mathematics known as nonlinear partial differential equations these are equations describing how variables for example temperature change in space and time and on notoriously difficult to solve as our graduates will attest nonlinear partial differential equations are used in applied mathematics to predict the weather to predict how a pandemic spreads how the air flows over the surface of an aircraft and how a solid body responds to stresses and strains so john's research is profound in two senses he has made both fundamental mathematical contributions to the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and also in their applications specifically to material science and liquid crystals he has pioneered work giving the first global existence theorems for energy minimization minimizing configurations in nonlinear elasticity under realistic hypothesis on the material response and the first rigorous treatment of non interpenetration of matter and cavitation and solids his work with richard james at the university of minnesota developed the now widely used mathematical theory of martensitic phase transformations and their microstructure as well as a theory of meta stability based on geometric incompatibility of parent and product phases in recognition of his outstanding research professor ball has many prestigious awards and prizes many more than i could possibly list here so let me single just sum out he is a fellow of the royal society a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and a fellow of the american mathematical society an associate longer academicians paris which is the french academy of sciences and a member of the european academy of sciences he was awarded the junior whitehead prize the nailor prize and the david crighton medal from the london mathematical society the latter prize jointly awarded by the institute for mathematics and its applications he was awarded the theodore von karman prize by the society for industrial and applied mathematics in nineteen ninety nine and more recent recently the king faisal prize for science in twenty eighteen in two thousand and six he received the royal medal which was instituted by her majesty the queen from the royal society of edinburgh and he was knighted in the new year's honours list that year for services to science professor ball has also dedicated many years of service to the mathematical community both nationally and internationally he is currently president of the royal society of edinburgh and he's been president of the edinburgh mathematical society president of the london mathematical society a member in nineteen ninety eight of the fields medal committee of the international mathematical union and the fields medal is the mathematical equivalent of the nobel prize he was the chair of the fields medal committee in two thousand and six and was a member of the first abel prize committee and he has served as the president of the international mathematical union from two thousand and three to two thousand and six professor balls outstanding contributions to applied mathematics research his role as a mathematical ambassador and his public service to the international mathematics community and wider scientific community make him a shining example to us all vice chancellor in recognition of his major contributions to applied mathematics i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science on norris kausa on

and friends it's a great privilege to receive this honour from saint andrews which i will always treasure and i would like to express my warm thanks to all at the university and in particular professor mark chaplin for his kind liation before the ceremony professor chaplin was joking that i should spend these few words explaining the concept of quasi convexity which is a an abstruse condition in mathematics which he knows i'm very fond of and and which like many things in mathematics is not very well understood but but don't worry i will resist the temptation to do this but it is a particular pleasure to be at a ceremony where among others many young mathematicians have graduated unlike those of you graduating today i happily did not have to pass any exams to receive this degree which is just as well since i did not do so brilliantly as an undergraduate luckily good people helped me on my way at at crucial moments so my hope is that all of you who now proudly have a degree from saint andrews are blessed with similar good fortune that you will help and be helped by others on your journey through life and that you will find the best way to contribute your talents to this world of unprecedented opportunities but also unprecedented challenges many congratulations to you all i call upon doctor owen jordan of the international education institute vice chancellor 's colleagues graduates and special guests i would like to start my address by offering my heartfelt congratulations to those of you who have graduated this morning from the schools of english mathematics and statistics and from the international education institute it is an honour to speak with you and your loved ones today and i hope that this ceremony will provide you with the sense of accomplishment and achievement that you deserve after the hard work that each of you has put into your studies whether these were focused on scottish literature statistical ecology or second language acquisition we are gathered here today to celebrate graduates from different backgrounds who studied at different levels and also via different modes of learning many of you will have experienced at least a component of online learning and online teaching as a result of the coronavirus pandemic however one cohort of today's graduates in teaching english to speakers of other languages or teisel studied both intentionally and entirely by distance learning often alongside full time work and family commitments i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the central place that our distance learning students occupy alongside those of you who studied in person within our diverse university community as is tradition at a graduation address as well as telling you how fantastic you are and how hard you've worked i will now attempt to offer some hopefully useful words of advice and in addition to reflecting on my own experiences i thought it would be beneficial to distill the essence of all the advice that has been offered to previous cohorts of graduates over the past four years with this in mind i created a small corpus of the twenty six graduation addresses that have been delivered in saint andrews since two thousand and eighteen linguistic analysis of this yielded a few useful pointers which i will convey to you now with some additional commentary from me firstly the word celebrate occurred sixteen times within my corpus and achievement occurred twenty times given the significance of your achievement in graduating today it is of great importance that you take the opportunity to celebrate extensively and to reward yourself for your hard work graduating from university is not a regular event in most people 's lives so please make sure to enjoy the experience and not just to take it off your list as another task done the word proud occurred twenty five times often being used to indicate that as a graduate you should be proud of yourself and of your achievements this is good advice i would encourage you to view your graduation from saint andrews a world leading university as evidence of your own abilities while this pride should not lead you to underestimate the abilities of others i hope that it will instill the confidence in you to meet the challenges that your future life may present in addition you should feel proud of the wider saint andrews community of which you are a member and the positive impact that this community has on the world in areas as diverse as energy innovation diplomacy medicine and cultural understanding when searching for commonly occurring phrases in the corpus there are also a few patterns while not as frequent as the single word matches the phrase make this world a better place appeared several times i would encourage you to take this on as your overarching goal for the future i am sure that those of you graduating today will follow a variety of different paths but i hope that in your separate pursuits you will do your best to ensure that the impact you have on the world around you is a positive one one final repeated phrase that i noted in the addresses was take a moment to reflect this too is great advice taking time to reflect on who you are what you have done and who and what you could be and do in the future will help you live a life that is aligned with your core values i suggest that moments of reflection should be repeated on a regular basis rather than being just a one off event to allow you to learn from your experiences and to integrate this learning into who you are so in summary celebrates be proud of yourself and the saint andrews community aim for a positive impact on the world and reflect regularly congratulations once again on this special day please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen",

am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were posted online due to the pandemic it is us with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends his teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremony is it opened in 1929 the younger all closed in july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised the space for the next century of its existence well centering the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations being refreshed intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger all stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observed today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals are our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors this is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliament since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduate serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of 15th century st andrews learn primarily through lengthy iterations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of the curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation like conducted in latin which made remained our official institutional language until 1747 examinations took the form of verbal interrogation by one of the professors and the discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both found at the 15th century st andrews as two distracting but artery and an important skill for the defence of the realm was prevented this may have occasioned second force in 1470 when after an unresolved argument the dean and the members of the faculty were set upon by students with those arrows student life incident and college over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidence more the statism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at 5:00 AM attended mass at six started classes at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now it will surprise you on weapons and the college strictly prohibited beers and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly for the biden let's say like football should prove too distracting with the exception of the single laundress and on the condition that she was over 15 years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time out of ferguson renowned lighting philosopher graduated in 1742 james wilson founding father of the united states started here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jumara in 1775 and in 1792 edward jenner who's advancements in the prevention of smallpox highly modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s and hundreds have become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus healthy retired sport in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the universities scotland act of 1858 introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full time study in 1892 and by the 1900 student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest implication of this is the university quincentennial centenary celebrations of september 1911 which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered deaths garden parties spread across town speeches were delivered representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and and 100 on 3 degrees withstood a student board place as well as a formal banquet staff gets in developmental group museum and the town came to life song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june 1929 its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of a building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes it is therefore sight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudy armus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the cover conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say ET super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or ferratum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduations into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete i shall then make a special presentation of the principles medal an award for academic and extra curricular endeavour to one of our graduates the principal's medal will today be bestowed bestowed upon george cherry of the school of mathematics and statistics same town theaters chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor sir john bull to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is doctor owen jordan from the international education institute the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduations are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrew and throughout your life decanus facultatif artsiom vice chancellor

medal this award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by ed and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and rope makers in the world the award of the principal's medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year 2021 to 2022 the principal's medal is being awarded to two outstanding students today we recognise george cherry who has just received the degree of master of mathematics with honours george is first and foremost a formidable scholar in the 13 modules she completed at saint andrews all but one received a first class mark and she graduates as one of the foremost students of her cohort george made the deans list for outstanding academic achievement in each year of study is described by her nominator as an outstanding and typically ambitious student and has further served her school as one of three student maths ambassadors since 2019 i'm delighted that george will continue her ambitious theoretical inquiries as a doctoral student at the university of oslo from september onwards such academic attainment is significant in itself but george is a polymath of renaissance proportions combining a huge work ethic with substantial natural talent that enables her to excel at all to which she turns her hand the most prominent of these is music and it is no overstatement to say that george is a student of breathtaking skill george is a university's foremost student pianist she has been a university piano scholar since the commencement of her studies in 2018 and she regularly performs at major university events i've had the pleasure of experiencing this and can attest that georgia's talents are unforgettable george also held a brass scholarship from 2020 to 2021 recognising her additional talent for trumpet playing and these are by no means the only instruments that she has mastered alongside working as a piano tutor at the night piano school in glasgow george is a formidable leader of musical life in our town organising or directing events since her first days in saint andrews during lockdown george musical directed via zoom an adaptation of mamma mia coordinating a 16 piece band and 25 person cast over two weeks of quarantine in 2019 for no reason other than to sustain a love for performance at a time of separation E covid restrictions have since enabled george to return to in person directing including a production of sweeney todd in saint andrews which she conducted and moves people directed last semester her last project was one of equal accomplishment and ambition a four hour musical performance on 4 adjacent pianos a simonton holtz canto ostinato delivered by 12 student pianists in the laidlaw music centre which george conceived and directed george is also an accomplished professional photographer and sports person she has competed internationally with oxford city boat club and she was a member of the women's first rugby team at saint andrews for two years in taking in all of these attainments and her very many others georges nominator concludes that the talent commitment and achievement shown by george only comes around once in a generation and as principal i could not agree more george in recognition of your superlative accomplishments both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal's medal i call upon professor mark chaplin of the school of mathematics and statistics vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science honoris causa professor sir john mcleod ball john mcleod ball was born in farnham surrey after attending mill hill school in london he obtained his undergraduate degree in mathematics from st john's college university of cambridge in 1969 and is defiled in mechanical engineering in 1972 from the university of sussex he did his postdoctoral research fellowship at heriot watt university in scotland and at brown university in the united states of america between 1974 and 1996 he was at heriot watt university where he became professor of applied analysis and from 1996 to 2018 he was the sadly and professor of natural philosophy at oxford and the sedley and chair is the oldest of oxford scientific chairs dating back to 1621 and there he was the director of the oxford centre for nonlinear partial differential equations he is currently professor in the school of mathematical and computer sciences at heriot watt university and also emeritus professor and emeritus fellow of queens college at the university of oxford and senior fellow at the hong kong institute for advanced study city university hong kong and over the years he has held numerous visiting positions in prestigious institutions across the world including the university of california berkeley university paris pierre marie curie in paris university of minnesota the institute for advanced study at princeton and the tata institute for fundamental research in bangalore so john's research is in the area of applied mathematics known as nonlinear partial differential equations these are equations describing how variables for example temperature change in space and time and on notoriously difficult to solve as our graduates will attest nonlinear partial differential equations are used in applied mathematics to predict the weather to predict how a pandemic spreads how the air flows over the surface of an aircraft and how a solid body responds to stresses and strains so john's research is profound in two senses he has made both fundamental mathematical contributions to the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and also in their applications specifically to material science and liquid crystals he has pioneered work giving the first global existence theorems for energy minimization minimizing configurations in nonlinear elasticity under realistic hypothesis on the material response and the first rigorous treatment of non interpenetration of matter and cavitation and solids his work with richard james at the university of minnesota developed the now widely used mathematical theory of martensitic phase transformations and their microstructure as well as a theory of meta stability based on geometric incompatibility of parent and product phases in recognition of his outstanding research professor ball has many prestigious awards and prizes many more than i could possibly list here so let me single just sum out he is a fellow of the royal society a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and a fellow of the american mathematical society an associate longer academicians paris which is the french academy of sciences and a member of the european academy of sciences he was awarded the junior whitehead prize the nailor prize and the david crighton medal from the london mathematical society the latter prize jointly awarded by the institute for mathematics and its applications he was awarded the theodore von karman prize by the society for industrial and applied mathematics in 1999 and more recent recently the king faisal prize for science in 2018 in 2006 he received the royal medal which was instituted by her majesty the queen from the royal society of edinburgh and he was knighted in the new year's honours list that year for services to science professor ball has also dedicated many years of service to the mathematical community both nationally and internationally he is currently president of the royal society of edinburgh and he's been president of the edinburgh mathematical society president of the london mathematical society a member in 1998 of the fields medal committee of the international mathematical union and the fields medal is the mathematical equivalent of the nobel prize he was the chair of the fields medal committee in 2006 and was a member of the first abel prize committee and he has served as the president of the international mathematical union from 2003 to 2006 professor balls outstanding contributions to applied mathematics research his role as a mathematical ambassador and his public service to the international mathematics community and wider scientific community make him a shining example to us all vice chancellor in recognition of his major contributions to applied mathematics i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science on norris kausa on professor sir john mcleod ball stay at gradam doctoris NCI on oris causal promove you queer spray in symbolum superette hope veratrum imponer congratulations vice chancellor faculty graduands parents and friends it's a great privilege to receive this honour from saint andrews which i will always treasure and i would like to express my warm thanks to all at the university and in particular professor mark chaplin for his kind liation before the ceremony professor chaplin was joking that i should spend these few words explaining the concept of quasi convexity which is a an abstruse condition in mathematics which he knows i'm very fond of and and which like many things in mathematics is not very well understood but but don't worry i will resist the temptation to do this but it is a particular pleasure to be at a ceremony where among others many young mathematicians have graduated unlike those of you graduating today i happily did not have to pass any exams to receive this degree which is just as well since i did not do so brilliantly as an undergraduate luckily good people helped me on my way at at crucial moments so my hope is that all of you who now proudly have a degree from saint andrews are blessed with similar good fortune that you will help and be helped by others on your journey through life and that you will find the best way to contribute your talents to this world of unprecedented opportunities but also unprecedented challenges many congratulations to you all i call upon doctor owen jordan of the international education institute vice chancellor's colleagues graduates and special guests i would like to start my address by offering my heartfelt congratulations to those of you who have graduated this morning from the schools of english mathematics and statistics and from the international education institute it is an honour to speak with you and your loved ones today and i hope that this ceremony will provide you with the sense of accomplishment and achievement that you deserve after the hard work that each of you has put into your studies whether these were focused on scottish literature statistical ecology or second language acquisition we are gathered here today to celebrate graduates from different backgrounds who studied at different levels and also via different modes of learning many of you will have experienced at least a component of online learning and online teaching as a result of the coronavirus pandemic however one cohort of today's graduates in teaching english to speakers of other languages or teisel studied both intentionally and entirely by distance learning often alongside full time work and family commitments i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the central place that our distance learning students occupy alongside those of you who studied in person within our diverse university community as is tradition at a graduation address as well as telling you how fantastic you are and how hard you've worked i will now attempt to offer some hopefully useful words of advice and in addition to reflecting on my own experiences i thought it would be beneficial to distill the essence of all the advice that has been offered to previous cohorts of graduates over the past four years with this in mind i created a small corpus of the 26 graduation addresses that have been delivered in saint andrews since 2018 linguistic analysis of this yielded a few useful pointers which i will convey to you now with some additional commentary from me firstly the word celebrate occurred 16 times within my corpus and achievement occurred 20 times given the significance of your achievement in graduating today it is of great importance that you take the opportunity to celebrate extensively and to reward yourself for your hard work graduating from university is not a regular event in most people's lives so please make sure to enjoy the experience and not just to take it off your list as another task done the word proud occurred 25 times often being used to indicate that as a graduate you should be proud of yourself and of your achievements this is good advice i would encourage you to view your graduation from saint andrews a world leading university as evidence of your own abilities while this pride should not lead you to underestimate the abilities of others i hope that it will instill the confidence in you to meet the challenges that your future life may present in addition you should feel proud of the wider st andrews community of which you are a member and the positive impact that this community has on the world in areas as diverse as energy innovation diplomacy medicine and cultural understanding when searching for commonly occurring phrases in the corpus there are also a few patterns while not as frequent as the single word matches the phrase make this world a better place appeared several times i would encourage you to take this on as your overarching goal for the future i am sure that those of you graduating today will follow a variety of different paths but i hope that in your separate pursuits you will do your best to ensure that the impact you have on the world around you is a positive one one final repeated phrase that i noted in the addresses was take a moment to reflect this too is great advice taking time to reflect on who you are what you have done and who and what you could be and do in the future will help you live a life that is aligned with your core values i suggest that moments of reflection should be repeated on a regular basis rather than being just a one off event to allow you to learn from your experiences and to integrate this learning into who you are so in summary celebrates be proud of yourself and the saint andrews community aim for a positive impact on the world and reflect regularly congratulations once again on this special day please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in

Really, that you handle prosecutor which could not stop ratio. Our team, of course. Yeah, and pretty quick to tour continues to notifications. Yeah, to the time I turn them conquer. Assume Dominum nostrum Amen. Please be seated. Good morning everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is. The highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic counter around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were posted online due to the pandemic. It is us with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, his teachers and loved ones. In the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremony is it opened in 1929. The younger all closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised the space for the next century of its existence. Well centering the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations being refreshed. Intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Today's graduates will cross the younger all stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observed today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals are our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape. Modern world we are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years. Students and academics gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled. The pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. This is not, however, a story of survival, but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and Parliament since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduate serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient. To history, but creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learn primarily through lengthy iterations delivered by their Masters and instructors, often in the teachers private residence as part of the curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics. All inspired by Aristotle speaking in the vernacular, was forbidden and teaching and conversation like conducted in Latin, which made remained our official institutional language until 1747. Examinations took the form of verbal interrogation by one of the professors, and the discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both found at the 15th century. St. Andrews as two distracting but artery and an important skill for the defence of the realm, was prevented. This may have occasioned second force in 1470, when after an unresolved argument the Dean and the members of the faculty were set upon by students with those arrows. Student life incident and college over. A century after our foundation in 1544, evidence more. The statism of the university, founded within a religious capital. Students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six started classes at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now it will surprise you on weapons and the college. Strictly prohibited beers and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly for the Biden. Let's say like football should prove too distracting, with the exception of the single laundress. And on the condition that she was over 15 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Out of Ferguson, renowned lighting philosopher graduated in 1742, James Wilson, founding father of the United States, started here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD. Doctor of Medicine by the university the French Revolutionary Jumara in 1775 and in 1792. Edward Jenner, who's advancements in the prevention of smallpox, highly modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s and hundreds have become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. Healthy retired sport in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by way of the Universities Scotland Act of 1858 introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day. Women were admitted to full time study in 1892 and by the 1900 student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences. Perhaps the greatest implication of this is the university quincentennial centenary celebrations of September 1911. Which resemble our activities today. Planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered deaths. Garden parties spread across town. Speeches were delivered. Representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and and 100 on 3 degrees withstood a student board place as well as a formal banquet. Staff gets in developmental group museum and the town came to life. Song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in June 1929. Its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of a building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successes. It is therefore sight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many. Have done before them. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudy armus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. The cover conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia, as that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition, I will call upon the Deans. In turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties. And I will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though I will simply say ET, super Tay, meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or ferratum touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduations into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, I shall then make a special presentation of the principles medal an award for academic and extra curricular endeavour to one of our graduates. The Principal's medal will today be bestowed, bestowed upon George Cherry of the School of Mathematics and Statistics. Same town theaters Chapel Choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins, for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Professor Sir John Bull. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates. Wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Doctor Owen Jordan from the International Education Institute. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduations are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So while you were graduating, you are not leaving. Our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience, and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a Saint, Andrew and throughout your life.

I should now like to introduce the principal's medal. This award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by Ed and Ravenscroft, believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and rope makers in the world. The award of the Principal's Medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at Saint Andrews. The awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline, and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular. For the academic year 2021 to 2022, the Principal's medal is being awarded to two outstanding students. Today we recognise George Cherry, who has just received the degree of Master of Mathematics with honours. George is first and foremost a formidable scholar. In the 13 modules she completed at Saint Andrews, all but one received a first class mark and she graduates as one of the foremost students of her cohort. George made the Deans list for outstanding academic achievement in each year of study is described by her nominator as an outstanding and typically ambitious student, and has further served her school as one of three student maths ambassadors since 2019. I'm delighted that George will continue her ambitious theoretical inquiries as a doctoral student at the University of Oslo from September onwards. Such academic attainment is significant in itself, but George is a polymath of Renaissance proportions. Combining a huge work ethic with substantial natural talent that enables her to excel at all to which she turns her hand. The most prominent of these is music, and it is no overstatement to say that George is a student of breathtaking skill. George is a university's foremost student pianist. She has been a university piano scholar since the commencement of her studies in 2018, and she regularly performs at major university events. I've had the pleasure of experiencing this and can attest that Georgia's talents are unforgettable. George also held a brass scholarship from 2020 to 2021, recognising her additional talent for trumpet playing, and these are by no means the only instruments that she has mastered. Alongside working as a piano tutor at the Night Piano School in Glasgow, George is a formidable leader of musical life in our town, organising or directing events. Since her first days in Saint Andrews. During lockdown, George Musical directed via Zoom, an adaptation of Mamma Mia coordinating a 16 piece band and 25 person cast over two weeks of quarantine in 2019 for no reason other than to sustain a love for performance at a time of separation. E COVID restrictions have since enabled George to return to in person directing, including a production of Sweeney Todd in Saint Andrews, which she conducted and moves. People directed last semester. Her last project was one of equal accomplishment and ambition. A four hour musical performance on 4 adjacent pianos. A Simonton, Holtz canto, ostinato delivered by 12 student pianists in the Laidlaw Music Centre, which George conceived and directed. George is also an accomplished professional photographer and sports person. She has competed internationally with Oxford City Boat Club and she was a member of the Women's first rugby team at Saint Andrews for two years. In taking in all of these attainments and her very many others, Georges nominator concludes that the talent, commitment, and achievement shown by George only comes around once in a generation and as principal. I could not agree more. George, in recognition of your superlative accomplishments both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate. It gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you. The principal's medal. I call upon Professor Mark Chaplin of the School of Mathematics and Statistics. Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science honoris causa Professor Sir John McLeod Ball. John McLeod Ball was born in Farnham, Surrey. After attending Mill Hill School in London, he obtained his undergraduate degree in mathematics from St. John's College, University of Cambridge in 1969 and is defiled in mechanical engineering in 1972 from the University of Sussex. He did his postdoctoral research fellowship at Heriot Watt University in Scotland and at Brown University in the United States of America. Between 1974 and 1996 he was at Heriot Watt University, where he became professor of Applied Analysis. And from 1996 to 2018 he was the sadly and Professor of natural philosophy at Oxford. And the Sedley and chair is the oldest of Oxford scientific chairs dating back to 1621 and there he was the director of the Oxford Centre for Nonlinear Partial Differential equations. He is currently professor in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot Watt University and also emeritus professor and Emeritus Fellow of Queens College at the University of Oxford and Senior Fellow at the Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study, City University, Hong Kong, and over the years he has held numerous visiting positions in prestigious institutions across the world, including the University of California, Berkeley University, Paris, Pierre Marie Curie in Paris. University of Minnesota. The Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research in Bangalore. So John's research is in the area of applied mathematics known as nonlinear partial differential equations. These are equations describing how variables, for example temperature change in space and time, and on notoriously difficult to solve as our graduates will attest. Nonlinear partial differential equations are used in applied mathematics to predict the weather to predict how a pandemic spreads, how the air flows over the surface of an aircraft, and how a solid body responds to stresses and strains. So John's research is profound in two senses. He has made both fundamental mathematical contributions to the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and also in their applications specifically to material science and liquid crystals. He has pioneered work, giving the first global existence theorems for energy minimization, minimizing configurations in nonlinear elasticity under realistic hypothesis on the material response, and the first rigorous treatment of non interpenetration of matter and cavitation and solids. His work with Richard James at the University of Minnesota developed the now widely used mathematical theory of martensitic phase transformations and their microstructure as well as a theory of meta. Stability based on geometric incompatibility of parent and product phases. In recognition of his outstanding research, Professor Ball has many prestigious awards and prizes. Many more than I could possibly list here. So let me single. Just sum out. He is a fellow of the Royal Society, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. An associate longer academicians Paris, which is the French Academy of Sciences and a member of the European Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Junior Whitehead Prize, the Nailor Prize, and the David Crighton Medal from the London Mathematical Society. The latter prize jointly awarded by the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications. He was awarded the Theodore von Karman Prize by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 1999, and more recent recently the King Faisal Prize for Science in 2018. In 2006, he received the Royal Medal, which was instituted by Her Majesty the Queen from the Royal Society of Edinburgh. And he was knighted in the New Year's Honours list that year for services to science. Professor Ball has also dedicated many years of service to the mathematical community both nationally and internationally. He is currently president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and he's been president of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, President of the London Mathematical Society, a member in 1998 of the Fields Medal Committee of the International Mathematical Union and the Fields Medal is the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize. He was the chair of the Fields Medal Committee in 2006 and was a member of the First Abel Prize committee, and he has served as the President of the International Mathematical Union from 2003 to 2006. Professor Balls outstanding contributions to applied mathematics research. His role as a mathematical ambassador and his public service to the International mathematics community and wider scientific community make him a shining example to us all. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contributions to applied mathematics, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science on Norris Kausa on Professor Sir John McLeod Ball.

It's a great privilege to receive this honour from Saint Andrews, which I will always treasure. And I would like to express my warm thanks to all at the university and in particular Professor Mark Chaplin for his kind liation before the ceremony. Professor Chaplin was joking that I should spend these few words explaining the concept of quasi convexity, which is a an abstruse condition in mathematics which he knows I'm very fond of, and, and which, like many things in mathematics, is not very well understood. But. But don't worry, I will resist the temptation to do this, but it is a particular pleasure to be at a ceremony where. Among others, many young mathematicians have graduated. Unlike those of you graduating today, I happily did not have to pass any exams to receive this degree. Which is just as well since I did not do so brilliantly as an undergraduate. Luckily good people helped me on my way at at crucial moments. So my hope is that all of you who now proudly have a degree from Saint Andrews are blessed with similar good fortune. That you will help and be helped by others on your journey through life. And that you will find the best way to contribute your talents to this world of unprecedented opportunities, but also unprecedented challenges. Many congratulations to you all. I call upon Doctor Owen Jordan of the International Education Institute. Vice Chancellor's colleagues, graduates and special guests. I would like to start my address by offering my heartfelt congratulations to those of you who have graduated this morning from the schools of English, Mathematics and statistics and from the International Education Institute. It is an honour to speak with you and your loved ones today, and I hope that this ceremony will provide you with the sense of accomplishment and achievement that you deserve after the hard work that each of you has put into your studies. Whether these were focused on Scottish literature, statistical ecology or second language acquisition. We are gathered here today to celebrate graduates from different backgrounds who studied at different levels and also via different modes of learning. Many of you will have experienced at least a component of online learning and online teaching as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. However, one cohort of today's graduates in teaching English to speakers of other languages or Teisel, studied both intentionally and entirely by distance learning, often alongside full time work and family commitments. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the central place that our distance learning students occupy alongside those of you who studied in person within our diverse university community. As is tradition at a graduation address as well as telling you how fantastic you are and how hard you've worked, I will now attempt to offer some hopefully useful words of advice. And in addition to reflecting on my own experiences, I thought it would be beneficial to distill the essence of all the advice that has been offered to previous cohorts of graduates over the past four years. With this in mind, I created a small corpus of the 26 graduation addresses that have been delivered in Saint Andrews since 2018. Linguistic analysis of this yielded a few useful pointers, which I will convey to you now, with some additional commentary from me. Firstly, the word celebrate occurred 16 times within my corpus and achievement occurred 20 times. Given the significance of your achievement in graduating today, it is of great importance that you take the opportunity to celebrate extensively and to reward yourself for your hard work. Graduating from university is not a regular event in most people's lives, so please make sure to enjoy the experience. And not just to take it off your list as another task done. The word proud occurred 25 times. Often being used to indicate that as a graduate you should be proud of yourself and of your achievements. This is good advice. I would encourage you to view your graduation from Saint Andrews, a world leading university as evidence of your own abilities. While this pride should not lead you to underestimate the abilities of others, I hope that it will instill the confidence in you to meet the challenges that your future life may present. In addition, you should feel proud of the wider St. Andrews community, of which you are a member and the positive impact that this Community has on the world in areas as diverse as energy, innovation, diplomacy, medicine, and cultural understanding. When searching for commonly occurring phrases in the corpus, there are also a few patterns. While not as frequent as the single word matches the phrase make this world a better place appeared several times. I would encourage you to take this on as your overarching goal for the future. I am sure that those of you graduating today will follow a variety of different paths, but I hope that in your separate pursuits you will do your best to ensure that the impact you have on the world around you is a positive one. One final repeated phrase that I noted in the addresses was take a moment to reflect. This too is great advice. Taking time to reflect on who you are, what you have done, and who and what you could be and do in the future will help you live a life that is aligned with your core values. I suggest that moments of reflection should be repeated on a regular basis rather than being just a one off event to allow you to learn from your experiences and to integrate this learning into who you are. So in summary, celebrates be proud of yourself and the Saint Andrews community. Aim for a positive impact on the world. And reflect regularly. Congratulations once again on this special day. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas de. At Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum Amen."
