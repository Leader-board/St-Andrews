occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ask however is not a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles have similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of the curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by one 's professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at fifteenth century saint andrews as two distracting but archery and important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasion second thoughts in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows student life in saint leonards college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started class at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one 's weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over fifty years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds saint andrews had become as described by one contemporary alumnus a healthy retired sport in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the universities scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduced the organizational organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundreds student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred gathered guests garden parties were spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of a hundred and forty five universities and learned societies visited and one hundred honorary degrees bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors it is their foresight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our theaters chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudi armas and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates hack cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from miss saint andrews taylor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete since our theaters chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour sir paul nurse to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor brad mckay the senior vice principal and vice principal for international strategy and external relations the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one

upon bishop wardlaw professor sir ian boyd of the school of biology vice chancellor it's my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science honorius cozar paul maxim nurse sir paul nurse could be fairly described as the greatest british scientist of today he attended he attended harrow county grammar school and graduated in biology from the university of birmingham in nineteen seventy and then took a PHD from the university of east anglia after postdoctoral studies at the university of edinburgh and a period as a fledgling academic at the university of sussex he moved to the imperial cancer research fund later cancer research UK where he eventually became director of research and then ultimately chief executive he also spent some time as the chair of the department of microbiology at the university of oxford sir paul 's research has focused on the genetic control of the cell cycle the process which leads to cell division and multiplication his early breakthrough was to discover a gene which coded for a protein that controlled the process of cell division in yeast he then found the homologue of this gene in humans since cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell division this had obvious applications for the understanding and treatment of this devastating disease in two thousand one sir paul was apart awarded a nobel prize for his discoveries of these proteins in nineteen eighty nine he was elected a fellow of the royal society and he became president of the royal society in two thousand and ten he was knighted in nineteen ninety nine as we and was made a companion of honour this year for services to science and medicine in the UK and abroad he is the recipient of numerous other awards for his research including the royal societies royal medal and the copley medal the albert lasker award for basic medical research the french liz young donayre the japanese order of the rising sun and the albert einstein world award of science sir paul has dedicated himself to leadership by also building scientific opportunities for others in addition to leading cancer research UK he has been president of rockefeller university in new york and in two thousand and ten he became the inaugural chief executive of the francis crick institute in london where he remains to this day in two thousand fifteen he made sweeping recommendations about how to improve the structure and organization of the UK 's sponsorship of research this led in two thousand eighteen to the creation of UK research and innovation which spends about eight point five billion pounds of taxpayers money on research every year vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to science i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science onerous coza on paul 's maxim nurse T aggrading doctoris CNC i honoris causa promoviendo course three in symbolum superette hope moretum imponent so many congratulations principle colleagues fellow graduations ladies and gentlemen let me start by saying what it's a real pleasure it is for me to be with you all in saint andrews today i want to say two things to you the first is to congratulate my fellow graduates sitting here in the front today who unlike me had to work to get their degrees today and it is really hard work to get a degree especially a good one so well done all of you be proud of yourselves be proud of what you have all achieved it's a special time for you the transition from being educated to doing what you will for the rest of your lives and good luck with all of that i suggest remember what you have learned here not just the details of your academic discipline but also how to think to challenge ideas to pursue truth in knowledge wherever it may lead and however uncomfortable it may be lessons may be that some of our political leaders need to learn today by the way but for now just be proud of what you've done what you've already achieved celebrate and of course enjoy your day the second thing i want to say it's thank you to the university thank you for this honorary degree thank both of you laborator principal for your kind and generous remarks i am delighted absolutely delighted to receive a degree from one of the great ancient universities of europe and i have to tell you it's a particular pleasure for me to receive this degree as i'm back in scotland you heard i spent a period of research and study in the university of edinburgh fifty years ago and my wife who's here today and myself came to scotland to edinburgh to start our careers and teaching in a school in stockbridge on the edge of the edinburgh newtown myself at kings buildings the department of zoology in the university of edinburgh and it was there i started the research that led to the understanding of how cells control their division in all animals in all plants fungi and also ourselves and the key the key that unlocked that understanding was a particular mutant that accelerated cell division in yeast cells before that cell could grow to the right size i called this mutant and the gene it identified we because it was small and to reflect its scottish heritage it is still called that today nearly fifty years later i was of course working on the other side of the firth of forth but came often here to the kingdom of fife i loved calling it the kingdom of five i was president of the university of edinburgh gliding club and we flew from port moak in fife next to loch leven many weekends i was there flying along the hills sometimes high in the mountains once i failed to get back to port moak and landed really quite close to saint andrews in a field they had to drag me back by car so being here is very special in a number of ways as i've just said both for anne and myself congratulations again my fellow graduates thank you once again the university of saint andrews for this honour thank you thank you i call upon the senior vice principal and vice principal for international strategy and external relations professor brad mckay vice chancellor distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen everyone it is my honor to address our new graduates on such a momentous occasion and i have to say it's a bit of a tough act following sir paul but i too want to begin by congratulating you all this small but mighty and ancient university situated up in the northeast of fife is not only one of if not the most difficult universities to gain admission to it is also the UK 's best university at least according to one notable league table today is your day to celebrate what is a tremendous achievement it is the culmination of all your lectures labs seminars tutorials reports experiments papers presentations and examinations and not only have you succeeded you have done so in the midst of a global pandemic one of the most challenging and disruptive periods of time in living memory but this only makes your accomplishments that much more impressive well this is rightfully your achievement it is also that of your family and friends who have supported you throughout but it's important also to remember that it's also a tough day for your supporters you stepped onto one side of the stage their kid you collected your degrees you stepped off the other side as a graduate you have effectively furloughed them so i think we should give a big round of applause to show our appreciation for your supporters in my academic career i study strategic planning and i have learned precisely three things the first is to draw on a danish proverb sometimes attributed to the twentieth century physicist niels bohr it's really really hard to make predictions especially about the future philosopher john dewey for example described textbooks as a fetish in the eighteen nineties mercedes forecasted a worldwide demand for automobiles of about one million in nineteen hundred because of the limited availability of chauffeurs in nineteen eleven thomas edison predicted the demise of the lecture with the invention of the motion picture in nineteen sixty two decor records conjectured that groups of guitars they're on their way out as they turn down the beatles and time magazine proffered that remote shopping would be a flop which brings me to the second thing that i've learned it's hard to predict the future precisely because as is sometimes said a little less politely stuff happens from the printing press to penicillin from amazon to tick tock from brexit to covid to viagra high impact things that we didn't expect sometimes do occur and things that we did expect do not always and this brings me to the third thing that i've learned which is best summed up by the late twentieth century psychologist and philosopher william james the world is as a consequent a blooming buzzing confusing place humans by nature desire certainty predictability and stability but as the fifth century BCE greek politician pericles noted so long ago one never steps in the same water twice in other words the world is one of perpetual movement indeterminacy and surprise but it is precisely this uncertainty that opens the possibility of changing shaping and reshaping the world we live in we are constantly bombarded by the challenges that we face automation climate change conflict environmental degradation fake news inequality unemployment social justice wealth generation the list goes on but where there are challenges and uncertainty there is also opportunity from the unexpected and incongruous the possibilities of new ways of doing things arise change is inevitable but outcomes from the biggest challenges we face are not who would have predicted that four working class guys from liverpool would change the course of music or a single mum writing in a cafe in edinburgh would create a global reading phenomena or the environmental protest of a schoolgirl in sweden would create a worldwide movement to arrest climate change or a comedian from ukraine would become one of the most dignified and courageous defenders of democratic principles of our time and at saint andrews our researchers are working together to develop new methods from how light emanates from the stars to treat skin cancer medical devices are being miniaturized to improve the health of those living in rural communities in africa new ways of managing enterprises sustainably are being pioneered bees are being trained to seek out land mines seals are being taught to sing the theme tune to star wars who would have thought but make no mistake the greatest impact we will have and the legacy that we are most proud of is our students what you're saint andrew 's degree signifies is not just that you've acquired a level of competency in a subject it's much more fundamental than that as lord mark sedwill former head of the UK civil service and a graduate of this university has said saint andrews was a big step into a bigger world more than a degree you have been taught to think to question to challenge and it gives you the confidence to embrace the uncertainties we face and with them to fashion a much more equal peaceful prosperous and sustainable planet so my advice is grab the opportunities fueled by uncertainty and if you miss one don't worry about it they're like seagulls and saint andrews is always one in the vicinity don't be afraid to fail just try to fail one less time than you succeed question those in authority just don't ask too many questions of them at one time less they become a bit irritable make mistakes but if you're an entrepreneur try to do it with someone else 's money walk your own trail unless of course you're lost in the highlands and then definitely use someone 's map alfred hitchcock was once asked how he makes such great films he allegedly replied that he starts with an earthquake and he builds from there you are now graduates of the university of saint andrews and part of a global community that is making a difference so when you venture away from here start with your own earthquakes and change the world a hearty congratulations once again and to use that wonderful scottish phrase hasty back please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicate CO spiritual sanctity sitcom omnibus nobis in secular secular orum amen",

promoviendo course three in symbolum superette hope moretum imponent so many congratulations principle colleagues fellow graduations ladies and gentlemen let me start by saying what it's a real pleasure it is for me to be with you all in saint andrews today i want to say two things to you the first is to congratulate my fellow graduates sitting here in the front today who unlike me had to work to get their degrees today and it is really hard work to get a degree especially a good one so well done all of you be proud of yourselves be proud of what you have all achieved it's a special time for you the transition from being educated to doing what you will for the rest of your lives and good luck with all of that i suggest remember what you have learned here not just the details of your academic discipline but also how to think to challenge ideas to pursue truth in knowledge wherever it may lead and however uncomfortable it may be lessons may be that some of our political leaders need to learn today by the way but for now just be proud of what you've done what you've already achieved celebrate and of course enjoy your day the second thing i want to say it's thank you to the university thank you for this honorary degree thank both of you laborator principal for your kind and generous remarks i am delighted absolutely delighted to receive a degree from one of the great ancient universities of europe and i have to tell you it's a particular pleasure for me to receive this degree as i'm back in scotland you heard i spent a period of research and study in the university of edinburgh 50 years ago and my wife who's here today and myself came to scotland to edinburgh to start our careers and teaching in a school in stockbridge on the edge of the edinburgh newtown myself at kings buildings the department of zoology in the university of edinburgh and it was there i started the research that led to the understanding of how cells control their division in all animals in all plants fungi and also ourselves and the key the key that unlocked that understanding was a particular mutant that accelerated cell division in yeast cells before that cell could grow to the right size i called this mutant and the gene it identified we because it was small and to reflect its scottish heritage it is still called that today nearly 50 years later i was of course working on the other side of the firth of forth but came often here to the kingdom of fife i loved calling it the kingdom of five i was president of the university of edinburgh gliding club and we flew from port moak in fife next to loch leven many weekends i was there flying along the hills sometimes high in the mountains once i failed to get back to port moak and landed really quite close to saint andrews in a field they had to drag me back by car so being here is very special in a number of ways as i've just said both for anne and myself congratulations again my fellow graduates thank you once again the university of saint andrews for this honour thank you thank you i call upon the senior vice principal and vice principal for international strategy and external relations professor brad mckay vice chancellor distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen everyone it is my honor to address our new graduates on such a momentous occasion and i have to say it's a bit of a tough act following sir paul but i too want to begin by congratulating you all this small but mighty and ancient university situated up in the northeast of fife is not only one of if not the most difficult universities to gain admission to it is also the UK's best university at least according to one notable league table today is your day to celebrate what is a tremendous achievement it is the culmination of all your lectures labs seminars tutorials reports experiments papers presentations and examinations and not only have you succeeded you have done so in the midst of a global pandemic one of the most challenging and disruptive periods of time in living memory but this only makes your accomplishments that much more impressive well this is rightfully your achievement it is also that of your family and friends who have supported you throughout but it's important also to remember that it's also a tough day for your supporters you stepped onto one side of the stage their kid you collected your degrees you stepped off the other side as a graduate you have effectively furloughed them so i think we should give a big round of applause to show our appreciation for your supporters in my academic career i study strategic planning and i have learned precisely three things the first is to draw on a danish proverb sometimes attributed to the 20th century physicist niels bohr it's really really hard to make predictions especially about the future philosopher john dewey for example described textbooks as a fetish in the 1890s mercedes forecasted a worldwide demand for automobiles of about 1,000,000 in 1900 because of the limited availability of chauffeurs in 1911 thomas edison predicted the demise of the lecture with the invention of the motion picture in 1962 decor records conjectured that groups of guitars they're on their way out as they turn down the beatles and time magazine proffered that remote shopping would be a flop which brings me to the second thing that i've learned it's hard to predict the future precisely because as is sometimes said a little less politely stuff happens from the printing press to penicillin from amazon to tick tock from brexit to covid to viagra high impact things that we didn't expect sometimes do occur and things that we did expect do not always and this brings me to the third thing that i've learned which is best summed up by the late 20th century psychologist and philosopher william james the world is as a consequent a blooming buzzing confusing place humans by nature desire certainty predictability and stability but as the 5th century BCE greek politician pericles noted so long ago one never steps in the same water twice in other words the world is one of perpetual movement indeterminacy and surprise but it is precisely this uncertainty that opens the possibility of changing shaping and reshaping the world we live in we are constantly bombarded by the challenges that we face automation climate change conflict environmental degradation fake news inequality unemployment social justice wealth generation the list goes on but where there are challenges and uncertainty there is also opportunity from the unexpected and incongruous the possibilities of new ways of doing things arise change is inevitable but outcomes from the biggest challenges we face are not who would have predicted that four working class guys from liverpool would change the course of music or a single mum writing in a cafe in edinburgh would create a global reading phenomena or the environmental protest of a schoolgirl in sweden would create a worldwide movement to arrest climate change or a comedian from ukraine would become one of the most dignified and courageous defenders of democratic principles of our time and at saint andrews our researchers are working together to develop new methods from how light emanates from the stars to treat skin cancer medical devices are being miniaturized to improve the health of those living in rural communities in africa new ways of managing enterprises sustainably are being pioneered bees are being trained to seek out land mines seals are being taught to sing the theme tune to star wars who would have thought but make no mistake the greatest impact we will have and the legacy that we are most proud of is our students what you're saint andrew's degree signifies is not just that you've acquired a level of competency in a subject it's much more fundamental than that as lord mark sedwill former head of the UK civil service and a graduate of this university has said saint andrews was a big step into a bigger world more than a degree you have been taught to think to question to challenge and it gives you the confidence to embrace the uncertainties we face and with them to fashion a much more equal peaceful prosperous and sustainable planet so my advice is grab the opportunities fueled by uncertainty and if you miss one don't worry about it they're like seagulls and saint andrews is always one in the vicinity don't be afraid to fail just try to fail one less time than you succeed question those in authority just don't ask too many questions of them at one time less they become a bit irritable make mistakes but if you're an entrepreneur try to do it with someone else's money walk your own trail unless of course you're lost in the highlands and then definitely use someone's map alfred hitchcock was once asked how he makes such great films he allegedly replied that he starts with an earthquake and he builds from there you are now graduates of the university of saint andrews and part of a global community that is making a difference so when you venture away from here start with your own earthquakes and change the world a hearty congratulations once again and to use that wonderful scottish phrase hasty back please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at

Good afternoon everyone. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ask, however, is not a story of survival, but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles have similar. Our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but. Creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors, often in the teachers private residence as part of the curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics. All inspired by Aristotle. Speaking in the vernacular was forbidden, and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in Latin, which remained our official institutional language until 1747. Examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by one's professors. And discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century St. Andrews as two distracting, but archery and important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted. This may have occasion second thoughts in 1470, when after an unresolved argument the Dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows. Student life in St. Leonards College. Over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university. Founded within a religious capital, students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six. Started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one's weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly forbidden, lest they, like football, should prove too distracting, with the exception of a single laundress. And on the condition that she was over 50 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Adam Ferguson, a renowned Enlightenment philosopher, graduated in 1742. James Wilson, a founding father of the United States, studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD or Doctor. Medicine by the university. The French revolutionary Jean Paul Marat in 1775. And in 1792 Edward Jenner, whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox, pioneered modern immunology. By the beginning of the 1800s, Saint Andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. A healthy retired sport in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by way of the Universities Scotland Act of 1858 introduced the organizational organizational structures which remain mostly intact. To this day, women were admitted to full-time study in 1892, and by the 1900s student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences. Perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of September 1911, which resemble our activities today. Planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests. Garden parties were spread across the town. Speeches were delivered. Representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees. Bestowed. A student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the Bell Pettigrew Museum, and the town came to life with song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in June 1929. Its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors. It is their foresight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better. As so many have done. Before them. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our theaters Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudi Armas and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor. Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition. I will call upon the Deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and I will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts and to symbolise this, I place upon you this cap. To most though, I will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates hack cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from Miss Saint Andrews Taylor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, since our theaters Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Sir Paul nurse. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates. Wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Professor Brad McKay, the senior vice principal and vice principal for international strategy and external relations. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So while you were graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a Saint, Andre and throughout your life. Decanus facultades artsiom vice chancellor.

Sir Paul nurse could be fairly described as the greatest British scientist of today. He attended, he attended Harrow County Grammar School and graduated in biology from the University of Birmingham in 1970. And then took a PhD from the University of East Anglia. After postdoctoral studies at the University of Edinburgh and a period as a fledgling academic at the University of Sussex, he moved to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Later Cancer Research UK, where he eventually became director of research and then ultimately chief executive. He also spent some time as the chair of the Department of Microbiology at the University of Oxford. Sir Paul's research has focused on the genetic control of the cell cycle, the process which leads to cell division and multiplication. His early breakthrough was to discover a gene which coded for a protein that controlled the process of cell division in yeast. He then found the homologue of this gene in humans. Since cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell division, this had obvious applications for the understanding and treatment of this devastating disease. In 2001, Sir Paul was apart, awarded a Nobel Prize for his discoveries of these proteins. In 1989 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and he became president of the Royal Society in 2010. He was knighted in 1999 as we and was made a Companion of honour this year for services to science and medicine in the UK and abroad. He is the recipient of numerous other awards for his research, including the Royal Societies Royal Medal and the Copley Medal. The Albert Lasker Award for Basic medical research. The French Liz young Donayre. The Japanese Order of the Rising Sun and the Albert Einstein World Award of Science. Sir Paul has dedicated himself to leadership by also building scientific opportunities for others. In addition to leading Cancer Research UK, he has been President of Rockefeller University in New York and in 2010 he became the inaugural chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute in London, where he remains to this day. In 2015, he made sweeping recommendations about how to improve the structure and organization of the UK's sponsorship of research. This led in 2018 to the creation of UK Research and innovation, which spends about £8.5 billion of taxpayers money on research every year. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to science, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science onerous coza on Paul's Maxim Nurse. T aggrading doctoris CNC I honoris causa promoviendo course three in symbolum superette hope moretum imponent. So many congratulations. Principle. Colleagues. Fellow graduations, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start by saying what it's a real pleasure. It is for me to be with you all in Saint Andrews today. I want to say two things to you. The first is to congratulate my fellow graduates sitting here in the front today. Who unlike me had to work to get their degrees today? And it is really hard work to get a degree, especially a good one. So well done, all of you. Be proud of yourselves. Be proud of what you have all achieved. It's a special time for you. The transition. From being educated. To doing what you will for the rest of your lives and good luck with all of that. I suggest remember what you have learned here. Not just the details of your academic discipline. But also how to think? To challenge ideas. To pursue truth in knowledge, wherever it may lead. And however uncomfortable it may be. Lessons may be that some of our political leaders need to learn today, by the way. But for now, just be proud of what you've done, what you've already achieved, celebrate and of course, enjoy your day. The second thing I want to say. It's thank you to the university. Thank you for this honorary degree. Thank both of you Laborator principal for your kind and generous remarks. I am delighted, absolutely delighted to receive a degree from one of the great ancient universities of Europe. And I have to tell you, it's a particular pleasure for me to receive this degree as I'm back in Scotland. You heard? I spent a period of research and study in the University of Edinburgh 50 years ago. And my wife, who's here today and myself, came to Scotland to Edinburgh to start our careers. And teaching in a school in Stockbridge on the edge of the Edinburgh Newtown myself at Kings buildings. The Department of Zoology in the University of Edinburgh. And it was there. I started the research. That led to the understanding of how cells control their division in all animals. In all plants, fungi, and also ourselves. And the key, the key that unlocked that understanding. Was a particular mutant that accelerated cell division in yeast cells before that cell could grow to the right size. I called this mutant and the gene it identified we. Because it was small. And to reflect its Scottish heritage. It is still called that today, nearly 50 years later. I was of course working on the other side of the Firth of Forth. But came often here to the Kingdom of Fife. I loved calling it the Kingdom of five. I was president of the University of Edinburgh Gliding Club and we flew from Port Moak. In Fife, next to Loch Leven. Many weekends I was there flying along the hills, sometimes high in the mountains. Once I failed to get back to Port Moak and landed really quite close to Saint Andrews in a field. They had to drag me back by car. So being here. Is very special in a number of ways. As I've just said both for Anne and myself. Congratulations again my fellow graduates. Thank you once again the University of Saint Andrews for this honour. Thank you, thank you. I call upon the Senior vice principal and vice Principal for international strategy and external relations. Professor Brad McKay. Vice Chancellor distinguished guests. Ladies and gentlemen everyone. It is my honor to address our new graduates on such a momentous occasion. And I have to say, it's a bit of a tough act following Sir Paul, but I too want to begin by congratulating you all. This small but mighty and ancient university, situated up in the northeast of Fife, is not only one of, if not the most difficult universities to gain admission to. It is also the UK's best university, at least according to one notable league table. Today is your day to celebrate what is a tremendous achievement. It is the culmination of all your lectures, labs, seminars, tutorials, reports, experiments, papers, presentations and examinations. And not only have you succeeded, you have done so in the midst of a global pandemic. One of the most challenging and disruptive periods of time in living memory. But this only makes your accomplishments that much more. Impressive, well, this is rightfully your achievement. It is also that of your family and friends who have supported you throughout, but it's important also to remember that it's also a tough day for your supporters. You stepped onto one side of the stage, their kid. You collected your degrees, you stepped off the other side. As a graduate, you have effectively furloughed them, so I think we should give a big round of applause. To show our appreciation for your supporters. In my academic career, I study strategic planning and I have learned precisely three things. The first is to draw on a Danish proverb, sometimes attributed to the 20th century physicist Niels Bohr. It's really, really hard to make predictions, especially about the future. Philosopher John Dewey, for example, described textbooks as a fetish in the 1890s, Mercedes forecasted a worldwide demand for automobiles of about 1,000,000 in 1900. Because of the limited availability of chauffeurs in 1911, Thomas Edison predicted the demise of the lecture with the invention of the motion picture in 1962. Decor records conjectured that groups of guitars. They're on their way out as they turn down The Beatles. And Time magazine proffered that remote shopping would be a flop. Which brings me to the second thing that I've learned. It's hard to predict the future precisely because, as is sometimes said, a little less politely stuff happens. From the printing press to penicillin, from Amazon to tick Tock from Brexit to COVID to Viagra high impact things that we didn't expect sometimes do occur and things that we did expect do not always and this brings me to the third thing. That I've learned which is best summed up by the late 20th century psychologist and philosopher William James, the world is as a consequent a blooming, buzzing, confusing place. Humans by nature, desire, certainty, predictability and stability. But as the 5th century BCE Greek politician Pericles noted so long ago. One never steps in the same water twice. In other words, the world is one of perpetual movement, indeterminacy and surprise, but it is precisely this uncertainty that opens the possibility of changing, shaping and reshaping the world we live in. We are constantly bombarded by the challenges that we face, automation, climate change, conflict, environmental degradation, fake news, inequality, unemployment, social justice, wealth generation. The list goes on. But where there are challenges and uncertainty, there is also opportunity. From the unexpected and incongruous, the possibilities of new ways of doing things arise. Change is inevitable. But outcomes from the biggest challenges we face are not who would have predicted that four working class guys from Liverpool would change the course of music or a single mum writing in a cafe in Edinburgh would create a global reading phenomena or the environmental protest of a schoolgirl in Sweden would create a worldwide movement to arrest climate change. Or a comedian from Ukraine would become one of the most dignified and courageous defenders. Of democratic principles of our time and at Saint Andrews, our researchers are working together to develop new methods from how light emanates from the stars to treat skin cancer. Medical devices are being miniaturized to improve the health of those living in rural communities in Africa. New ways of managing enterprises sustainably are being pioneered. Bees are being trained to seek out land mines. Seals are being taught to sing the theme tune to Star Wars. Who would have thought? But make no mistake, the greatest impact we will have and the legacy that we are most proud of is our students. What you're Saint Andrew's degree signifies is not just that you've acquired a level of competency in a subject. It's much more fundamental than that, as Lord Mark Sedwill, former head of the UK Civil Service and a graduate of this university, has said Saint Andrews was a big step into a bigger world more than a degree. You have been taught to think to question, to challenge, and it gives you the confidence to embrace. The uncertainties we face and with them to fashion a much more equal, peaceful, prosperous and sustainable planet. So my advice is, grab the opportunities fueled by uncertainty and if you miss one, don't worry about it. They're like seagulls and Saint Andrews is always one in the vicinity. Don't be afraid to fail, just try to fail one less time than you succeed. Question those in authority just don't ask too many questions of them at one time. Less they become a bit irritable, make mistakes, but if you're an entrepreneur, try to do it with someone else's money. Walk your own trail. Unless of course you're lost in the Highlands and then definitely use someone's map. Alfred Hitchcock was once asked how he makes such great films. He allegedly replied that he starts with an earthquake and he builds from there. You are now graduates of the University of Saint Andrews and part of a global community that is making a difference. So when you venture away from here, start with your own earthquakes and change the world a hearty congratulations once again and to use that wonderful Scottish phrase hasty back. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicate Co spiritual sanctity sitcom omnibus nobis in secular secular orum Amen."
