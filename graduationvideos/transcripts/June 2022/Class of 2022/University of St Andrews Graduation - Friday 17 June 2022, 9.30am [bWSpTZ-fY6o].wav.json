the principle of the university good morning everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i'm delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremony since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proven resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a center for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal book bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into the town the following february these people bulls granted the university the authority to award degrees in five faculties arts theology cannon and civil law and medicine situating medicine at the heart of our fifteenth century identity however a critical mass of strength in the faculties of arts and divinity meant that medicine was overshadowed in the early curriculum and it was not until the eighteenth century that it became an entrenched part of our practice this was consolidated in seventeen twenty one by the establishment of the chandos chair of medicine and anatomy by the then chancellor james bridges first duke of chandelles medical training in the eighteenth century bore little of its current rigor and the degree of doctor of medicine or MD was typically presented to candidates who accumulated experiences physicians and who were vouched for by their contemporary practitioners the first recorded award was made to john arbuthnot a satirist physician and polymath of renown in sixteen ninety six and subsequent medical graduates have made global contributions they included jean paul mara the french revolutionary who graduated in seventeen seventy five and edward jenner who received his MD in seventeen ninety two and whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology it was not until the creation of the conjoint medical school with university college dundee in eighteen ninety eight that a full medical training programme and examination record were required before candidates could graduate the delivery of this program was ruptured however by the separation of the university of dundee from saint andrews in nineteen sixty seven and the establishment then of a legal quirk that prevented saint andrews from awarding clinical medical degrees our internationally leading school of medicine has since delivered a unique preclinical programme with further medical training completed a partner institutions that legal restriction was removed in march twenty twenty one when the scottish parliament unanimously passed the university of saint andrews degrees in medicine and dentistry bill restoring our capacity to award medical degrees students today will graduate with the degree of bachelor of science as part of our standard preclinical training program this historic ceremony will also see the implementation of our renewed awarding powers when we bestow medical degrees jointly with the university of dundee upon the first cohort of scholars graduating from our scott gem programme scott gem or scottish graduate entry medicine is a pioneering four year course specifically tailored to train the next generation of medical practitioners and with respect for the priorities of the national health service it is taught taught jointly by the universities of saint andrews and dundee in partnership with the university of the highlands and islands while drawing also upon the broader strengths of the scottish higher education sector that scoop recognises scott gems particular focus on training future general practitioners who are cognizant of the healthcare needs of rural communities and equipped with the will and capacity to improve provision in recognizing the thoroughly collaborative nature of this programme and the joint degree award with the university of dundee i am delighted to welcome guests from our partner universities to today's ceremony and in particular the principal and vice chancellor of the university of dundee professor ian gillespie the principal and vice chancellor of the university of of the highlands and islands professor todd walker and the chief medical officer for scotland professor sir gregor smith i am pleased also to recognise the presence of the university of dundees mace amongst the six maces surrounding the chancellor the university of saint andrews maces of which there are seven in total former collection that is unrivaled by any other university and they appear on rotation at the ceremonies as they have for as long as graduation has occurred at saint andrews three of them present today the mace of the faculty of arts the mace of the faculty of canon law and the mace of saint salvator 's college date to the fifteenth century and they're joined today by two of our more recent maces the mesa the school of medicine presented by an anonymous donor in nineteen forty nine and the university mace acquired in nineteen fifty eight the university of dundee mass which at this particular ceremony today is sitting alongside our own in recognition of the collaborative nature of today's celebration was created in nineteen eleven and has been used at every dundee graduation ceremony since nineteen sixty eight medical training throughout our history has been enriched and strengthened by collaboration scott gem draws its power from the coalition of our excellence and expertise with those of our partner institutions and today's inaugural cohort serves as a shining example of the rewards to be reaped through collaboration returning now to today's ceremonies and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since sylvatus chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mccuen delivered the opening prayer as principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all after which the presentation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition the chancellor will call upon the deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used at every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our academic community when the conferrals are complete since our vegas chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innis hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor sir ian gilmore to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor katie stevenson vice principal for collections music and digital content the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andre and throughout your life the canoes faculty

professor david crossman chancellor is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of medicine or norris cowser professor sir ian gilmore iran 's problem is alcohol you know where to get it how much it will cost and so on alcohol enjoyed by many including in has a huge negative impact on individuals and society acutely it's associated with injury and sometimes death chronically it causes social destruction and domestic harm liver failure and cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma pancreatitis many neurological problems and an increased risk of many other cancers it affects the unborn fetus amongst the many others secondarily affected by those who drink inappropriately ian as a practicing gastroenterologist and hepatologist saw this on a daily basis and he used his positions most notably as president of the royal college of physicians to increase awareness of these issues and to change policy policy response to established public health science is tough and takes a long time look at smoking the smoking ban took in the region of forty years from established fact to policy ian has undertaken this long route for alcohol misuse and it is greatly to his credit in two thousand and seven he an established the alcohol health alliance and continues to chair this his established the centre for alcohol research at the university of liverpool though he admits to never having held an academic post he has enjoyed tinkering with research as he puts it but i think it's been rather more than that he admits that no country has got the policy on alcohol right prohibition in the united states of america did not work and is not realistic he emphasises the french policy of a total ban on broadcast and sports sponsorship and this is one that seems sensible in sweden he notes that all outlets of sale are under strict government control and in both these countries these measures seem to have had beneficial effect he feels the scottish government policy different from england of minimum unit pricing and the restrictions of time of sale time of sale may have benefit but some of these sadly have been lost during the covid pandemic what he's keen to emphasize is we must change the whole dialogue on alcohol deflate the heroic view of drinking and move society to a better place this is embodied in his approaches to stakeholders through the alcohol health alliance suriyan is the embodiment of a medical practitioner who wants to make a difference he will have done that through his daily practice which incidentally he continued whilst he was president of the royal college of physicians but beyond that he saw that he had opportunities to make changes in public health in public health policy today as we graduate medical students again after a fifty year pause his example is one that should guide all our graduates but particularly our medical graduates use your qualifications training and privilege to make a difference sir ian certainly has chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to medicine i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of medicine on oris cowser on professor sir ian gilmore taylor graham doctoris medicinae on noras kaza from movio could you spray in symbolum supertek hope we retain manpower chancellor vice chancellor dean and all those others here who have made today such a wonderful success at very big thank you it's customary to say a few words on these occasions it's personally a great honour and and joy to me and i have some connections with with this university that were unknown to those who awarded me this degree they did not know that my father was sitting where you are in nineteen thirty five and became a medical doctor and managed to live for another seventy years so there's hope for you all they didn't know that i was delivered into this world by an obstetrician in dundee who was the first female professor in the university of saint andrews professor margaret fairley so i was in touch literally as well as metaphorically with the university from an early age a big thank you to the university for giving me this honor it's customary to say a few words in the new graduates you're no longer graduands you're graduates and these will be particularly directed towards the medical graduates here and it's an absolute pleasure to be here on the first occasion in fifty years that the medical primary medical degree has been given and also the time that this wonderful scott gem project has come to fruition and i really look forward to looking at the progress it makes over the coming years and the difference it makes particularly in the highlands and the highlands so some advice to you all well i think as someone who never planned anything in this career i think the most important advice is be lucky the other thing i would say is and it's easy to forget this in the heat of a medical take at two in the morning overburdened understaffed but remember the privilege it is to be a doctor it is a real privilege that patients will unburden themselves of their most secret fears concerns worries symptoms and put their trust in you to do something about it it is a privilege it's all too easy to forget but all too important to remember beyond that i would like to say that as i've been called sometimes the alcohol guru my advice to you is forget about the limits tonight but return that was very cool it's but please return to them tomorrow thank you please stand for the benediction sorry i beg your pardon as you were i haven't been following the honorary graduates advice i can assure you with my embarrassment very fully available i call upon the principle of the university it was a long day yesterday i call upon katie stevenson the vice principal for collections music and digital content in order to deliver the graduation address chancellor 's principal distinguished guests and graduates of the university of saint andrews on behalf of my colleagues here on the stage and all of those at the university i'm honoured to be the first to say to you congratulations it's my duty today to say some words that you'll find meaningful and reflect the mood of the graduation ritual it's unlikely you're gonna remember anything i've said by suppertime because today is really too thrilling filled with excitement pride and that knowingly nostalgic feeling when one moves through a ritual ending and says goodbye to everything that has passed and looks ahead to something else a different beginning that will bring trepidation challenges discomfort uncertainty and across time more learning growth failures and accomplishments as a cohort you two will remember with fondness your arrival at this university having crossed a similar threshold when you left your last milestone and came here bright excited and ready to take every opportunity that this new life offered to you i hope you did i commend you for the way in which you face challenges never before known in the history of university education when you studied at home and met your friends on a screen in some cases unable to do the very actions which attracted you to a future in health and medical sciences in the first place the comforting of someone in pain with a touch of your hand that you have emerged as graduates through this time is a stupendous achievement and one which we are all your family your loved ones your lecturers and tutors and your friends extraordinarily impressed i'm an historian that's why i'm quite wordy a discipline which reflects on how people understand and write about the events which they have experienced and how memory changes distorts recreates or disappears over time in the coming days and weeks spend some time reflecting on your university years and on the pandemic in particular you will already have noticed that as the immediacy of its effects have diminished we are quick to forget what we experienced do not lose the opportunity to remind yourself of your history to take stock of the lessons you have learned remind yourself of the people who have influenced or impacted upon you and celebrate that who you were when you arrived at saint andrews is leaving saint andrews as someone a little older who knows a lot more and who has experienced intensive challenges that brought you remarkable resilience in the two thousand and eighteen book the coddling of the american mind the authors quoted from a speech that the then chief justice of the united states john roberts had delivered just a year earlier invited to give the commencement address at a middle school roberts used this as an opportunity to make a plea for resilience in a generation which he saw as being too fragile and inexperienced with the real demands of contributing positively to adult society and i'm i'm going to quote from his speech historians are inclined to quote length when someone captures an essential truth in their words so bear with me it's worth it i quote from time to time in the years to come i hope you will be treated unfairly so that you will come to know the value of justice i hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty sorry to say but i hope you will that you will be lonely from time to time so that you don't take friends for granted i wish you bad luck again from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not entirely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either and when you lose as you will from time to time i hope every now and then your opponent will gloat over your failure it is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship i hope you'll be ignored so that you know the importance of listening to others and i hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion whether i wish these things or not they're going to happen and whether you benefit from them or not will depend on your ability to see the message in your misfortunes now i do not follow robert 's position entirely and i do not wish these things for you you are not eleven and you've not just started on your middle and high school journeys and you have already experienced these things and likely often but i would like you to remember as you navigate the next steps of your lives that whilst you have i hope just experienced the most challenging years of those lives to date far more challenging than any of us could have anticipated that life will continue to challenge you and that in that challenge will come the opportunity to learn to grow and to continue to pursue a life of worthwhile contribution over six hundred years ago when the university was first founded the historian walter bauer described the celebrations of the townspeople of saint andrews university teachers and students as they came together in celebration on a day not unlike today there was boundless merrymaking large bonfires burning in the streets and as tradition may prove a lot of wine was consumed bauer also observed again i quote some people think that there is one thing in the university in recent times that is not only reprehensible but also needs changing not referring to the wine namely that when students begin to learn and obtain degrees they soon leave and thus demean the learning which ought to distinguish them bower thought that students should learn at university and then stay on to teach others and contemplate philosophically the problems the world faced not to go out into the world to take their knowledge and skills with them to other organisations whilst my colleagues and i are here on the stage have followed bowers preferred path you will all be relieved to hear that we are actually delighted that having obtained your degree you will definitely be leaving but do take bowers point to heart do not demean your learning rather let your learning distinguish you in your career graduation addresses are by their very nature a moment for the university to give something of a a celebratory push out of the nest today as a graduate of this ancient university you stand as a credit to yourself we hope that what's in andrews has provided for you will give you the knowledge the wisdom and the resilience to succeed to prosper to make a worthwhile contribution to society and to be happy ever to excel that was some diffidence please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas day at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular

are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i'm delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremony since it opened in 1929 the younger hall closed in july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proven resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the 12th century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a center for pilgrimage home to scotland's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in 1318 university instruction commenced here in may 1410 when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the 13th issued papal book bulls from peniscola in august 1413 which were met by great jubilation when carried into the town the following february these people bulls granted the university the authority to award degrees in five faculties arts theology cannon and civil law and medicine situating medicine at the heart of our 15th century identity however a critical mass of strength in the faculties of arts and divinity meant that medicine was overshadowed in the early curriculum and it was not until the 18th century that it became an entrenched part of our practice this was consolidated in 1721 by the establishment of the chandos chair of medicine and anatomy by the then chancellor james bridges first duke of chandelles medical training in the 18th century bore little of its current rigor and the degree of doctor of medicine or MD was typically presented to candidates who accumulated experiences physicians and who were vouched for by their contemporary practitioners the first recorded award was made to john arbuthnot a satirist physician and polymath of renown in 1696 and subsequent medical graduates have made global contributions they included jean paul mara the french revolutionary who graduated in 1775 and edward jenner who received his MD in 1792 and whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology it was not until the creation of the conjoint medical school with university college dundee in 1898 that a full medical training programme and examination record were required before candidates could graduate the delivery of this program was ruptured however by the separation of the university of dundee from saint andrews in 1967 and the establishment then of a legal quirk that prevented st andrews from awarding clinical medical degrees our internationally leading school of medicine has since delivered a unique preclinical programme with further medical training completed a partner institutions that legal restriction was removed in march 2021 when the scottish parliament unanimously passed the university of saint andrews degrees in medicine and dentistry bill restoring our capacity to award medical degrees students today will graduate with the degree of bachelor of science as part of our standard preclinical training program this historic ceremony will also see the implementation of our renewed awarding powers when we bestow medical degrees jointly with the university of dundee upon the first cohort of scholars graduating from our scott gem programme scott gem or scottish graduate entry medicine is a pioneering 4 year course specifically tailored to train the next generation of medical practitioners and with respect for the priorities of the national health service it is taught taught jointly by the universities of saint andrews and dundee in partnership with the university of the highlands and islands while drawing also upon the broader strengths of the scottish higher education sector that scoop recognises scott gems particular focus on training future general practitioners who are cognizant of the healthcare needs of rural communities and equipped with the will and capacity to improve provision in recognizing the thoroughly collaborative nature of this programme and the joint degree award with the university of dundee i am delighted to welcome guests from our partner universities to today's ceremony and in particular the principal and vice chancellor of the university of dundee professor ian gillespie the principal and vice chancellor of the university of of the highlands and islands professor todd walker and the chief medical officer for scotland professor sir gregor smith i am pleased also to recognise the presence of the university of dundees mace amongst the six maces surrounding the chancellor the university of saint andrews maces of which there are seven in total former collection that is unrivaled by any other university and they appear on rotation at the ceremonies as they have for as long as graduation has occurred at saint andrews three of them present today the mace of the faculty of arts the mace of the faculty of canon law and the mace of saint salvator's college date to the 15th century and they're joined today by two of our more recent maces the mesa the school of medicine presented by an anonymous donor in 1949 and the university mace acquired in 1958 the university of dundee mass which at this particular ceremony today is sitting alongside our own in recognition of the collaborative nature of today's celebration was created in 1911 and has been used at every dundee graduation ceremony since 1968 medical training throughout our history has been enriched and strengthened by collaboration scott gem draws its power from the coalition of our excellence and expertise with those of our partner institutions and today's inaugural cohort serves as a shining example of the rewards to be reaped through collaboration returning now to today's ceremonies and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since sylvatus chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mccuen delivered the opening prayer as principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all after which the presentation of degrees by the chancellor lord campbell of pittenweem will commence the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition the chancellor will call upon the deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though the chancellor will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduand this academic cap has been used at every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our academic community when the conferrals are complete since our vegas chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innis hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor sir ian gilmore to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor katie stevenson vice principal for collections music and digital content the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so while you

chancellor is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of medicine or norris cowser professor sir ian gilmore iran's problem is alcohol you know where to get it how much it will cost and so on alcohol enjoyed by many including in has a huge negative impact on individuals and society acutely it's associated with injury and sometimes death chronically it causes social destruction and domestic harm liver failure and cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma pancreatitis many neurological problems and an increased risk of many other cancers it affects the unborn fetus amongst the many others secondarily affected by those who drink inappropriately ian as a practicing gastroenterologist and hepatologist saw this on a daily basis and he used his positions most notably as president of the royal college of physicians to increase awareness of these issues and to change policy policy response to established public health science is tough and takes a long time look at smoking the smoking ban took in the region of 40 years from established fact to policy ian has undertaken this long route for alcohol misuse and it is greatly to his credit in 2007 he an established the alcohol health alliance and continues to chair this his established the centre for alcohol research at the university of liverpool though he admits to never having held an academic post he has enjoyed tinkering with research as he puts it but i think it's been rather more than that he admits that no country has got the policy on alcohol right prohibition in the united states of america did not work and is not realistic he emphasises the french policy of a total ban on broadcast and sports sponsorship and this is one that seems sensible in sweden he notes that all outlets of sale are under strict government control and in both these countries these measures seem to have had beneficial effect he feels the scottish government policy different from england of minimum unit pricing and the restrictions of time of sale time of sale may have benefit but some of these sadly have been lost during the covid pandemic what he's keen to emphasize is we must change the whole dialogue on alcohol deflate the heroic view of drinking and move society to a better place this is embodied in his approaches to stakeholders through the alcohol health alliance suriyan is the embodiment of a medical practitioner who wants to make a difference he will have done that through his daily practice which incidentally he continued whilst he was president of the royal college of physicians but beyond that he saw that he had opportunities to make changes in public health in public health policy today as we graduate medical students again after a 50 year pause his example is one that should guide all our graduates but particularly our medical graduates use your qualifications training and privilege to make a difference sir ian certainly has chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to medicine i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of medicine on oris cowser on professor sir ian gilmore taylor graham doctoris medicinae on noras kaza from movio could you spray in symbolum supertek hope we retain manpower chancellor vice chancellor dean and all those others here who have made today such a wonderful success at very big thank you it's customary to say a few words on these occasions it's personally a great honour and and joy to me and i have some connections with with this university that were unknown to those who awarded me this degree they did not know that my father was sitting where you are in 1935 and became a medical doctor and managed to live for another 70 years so there's hope for you all they didn't know that i was delivered into this world by an obstetrician in dundee who was the first female professor in the university of saint andrews professor margaret fairley so i was in touch literally as well as metaphorically with the university from an early age a big thank you to the university for giving me this honor it's customary to say a few words in the new graduates you're no longer graduands you're graduates and these will be particularly directed towards the medical graduates here and it's an absolute pleasure to be here on the 1st occasion in 50 years that the medical primary medical degree has been given and also the time that this wonderful scott gem project has come to fruition and i really look forward to looking at the progress it makes over the coming years and the difference it makes particularly in the highlands and the highlands so some advice to you all well i think as someone who never planned anything in this career i think the most important advice is be lucky the other thing i would say is and it's easy to forget this in the heat of a medical take at 2:00 in the morning overburdened understaffed but remember the privilege it is to be a doctor it is a real privilege that patients will unburden themselves of their most secret fears concerns worries symptoms and put their trust in you to do something about it it is a privilege it's all too easy to forget but all too important to remember beyond that i would like to say that as i've been called sometimes the alcohol guru my advice to you is forget about the limits tonight but return that was very cool it's but please return to them tomorrow thank you please stand for the benediction sorry i beg your pardon as you were i haven't been following the honorary graduates advice i can assure you with my embarrassment very fully available i call upon the principle of the university it was a long day yesterday i call upon katie stevenson the vice principal for collections music and digital content in order to deliver the graduation address chancellor's principal distinguished guests and graduates of the university of saint andrews on behalf of my colleagues here on the stage and all of those at the university i'm honoured to be the first to say to you congratulations it's my duty today to say some words that you'll find meaningful and reflect the mood of the graduation ritual it's unlikely you're gonna remember anything i've said by suppertime because today is really too thrilling filled with excitement pride and that knowingly nostalgic feeling when one moves through a ritual ending and says goodbye to everything that has passed and looks ahead to something else a different beginning that will bring trepidation challenges discomfort uncertainty and across time more learning growth failures and accomplishments as a cohort you two will remember with fondness your arrival at this university having crossed a similar threshold when you left your last milestone and came here bright excited and ready to take every opportunity that this new life offered to you i hope you did i commend you for the way in which you face challenges never before known in the history of university education when you studied at home and met your friends on a screen in some cases unable to do the very actions which attracted you to a future in health and medical sciences in the 1st place the comforting of someone in pain with a touch of your hand that you have emerged as graduates through this time is a stupendous achievement and one which we are all your family your loved ones your lecturers and tutors and your friends extraordinarily impressed i'm an historian that's why i'm quite wordy a discipline which reflects on how people understand and write about the events which they have experienced and how memory changes distorts recreates or disappears over time in the coming days and weeks spend some time reflecting on your university years and on the pandemic in particular you will already have noticed that as the immediacy of its effects have diminished we are quick to forget what we experienced do not lose the opportunity to remind yourself of your history to take stock of the lessons you have learned remind yourself of the people who have influenced or impacted upon you and celebrate that who you were when you arrived at saint andrews is leaving saint andrews as someone a little older who knows a lot more and who has experienced intensive challenges that brought you remarkable resilience in the 2018 book the coddling of the american mind the authors quoted from a speech that the then chief justice of the united states john roberts had delivered just a year earlier invited to give the commencement address at a middle school roberts used this as an opportunity to make a plea for resilience in a generation which he saw as being too fragile and inexperienced with the real demands of contributing positively to adult society and i'm i'm going to quote from his speech historians are inclined to quote length when someone captures an essential truth in their words so bear with me it's worth it i quote from time to time in the years to come i hope you will be treated unfairly so that you will come to know the value of justice i hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty sorry to say but i hope you will that you will be lonely from time to time so that you don't take friends for granted i wish you bad luck again from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not entirely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either and when you lose as you will from time to time i hope every now and then your opponent will gloat over your failure it is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship i hope you'll be ignored so that you know the importance of listening to others and i hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion whether i wish these things or not they're going to happen and whether you benefit from them or not will depend on your ability to see the message in your misfortunes now i do not follow robert's position entirely and i do not wish these things for you you are not 11 and you've not just started on your middle and high school journeys and you have already experienced these things and likely often but i would like you to remember as you navigate the next steps of your lives that whilst you have i hope just experienced the most challenging years of those lives to date far more challenging than any of us could have anticipated that life will continue to challenge you and that in that challenge will come the opportunity to learn to grow and to continue to pursue a life of worthwhile contribution over 600 years ago when the university was first founded the historian walter bauer described the celebrations of the townspeople of saint andrews university teachers and students as they came together in celebration on a day not unlike today there was boundless merrymaking large bonfires burning in the streets and as tradition may prove a lot of wine was consumed bauer also observed again i quote some people think that there is one thing in the university in recent times that is not only reprehensible but also needs changing not referring to the wine namely that when students begin to learn and obtain degrees they soon leave and thus demean the learning which ought to distinguish them bower thought that students should learn at university and then stay on to teach others and contemplate philosophically the problems the world faced not to go out into the world to take their knowledge and skills with them to other organisations whilst my colleagues and i are here on the stage have followed bowers preferred path you will all be relieved to hear that we are actually delighted that having obtained your degree you will definitely be leaving but do take bowers point to heart do not demean your learning rather let your learning distinguish you in your career graduation addresses are by their very nature a moment for the university to give something of a a celebratory push out of the nest today as a graduate of this ancient university you stand as a credit to yourself we hope that what's in andrews has provided for you will give you the knowledge the wisdom and the resilience to succeed to prosper to make a worthwhile contribution to society and to be happy ever to excel that was some diffidence please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas

I call upon the principle of the university. Good morning everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I'm delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremony. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proven resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural and intellectual development since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a Center for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal book bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into the town the following February. These people bulls granted the university the authority to award degrees in five faculties, arts, theology, cannon and civil law and medicine, situating medicine at the heart of our 15th century identity. However, a critical mass of strength in the faculties of Arts and Divinity meant that medicine was overshadowed in the early curriculum and it was not until the 18th century that it became an entrenched part of our practice. This was consolidated in 1721 by the establishment of the Chandos Chair of Medicine and Anatomy by the then Chancellor James Bridges, First Duke of Chandelles. Medical training in the 18th century bore little of its current rigor and the degree of Doctor of Medicine or MD was typically presented to candidates who accumulated experiences, physicians, and who were vouched for by their contemporary practitioners. The first recorded award was made to John Arbuthnot, a satirist physician and polymath of renown. In 1696 and subsequent medical graduates have made global contributions. They included Jean Paul Mara, the French revolutionary who graduated in 1775, and Edward Jenner, who received his MD in 1792 and whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology. It was not until the creation of the Conjoint Medical School with University College Dundee in 1898 that a full medical training programme and examination record were required before candidates could graduate. The delivery of this program was ruptured, however, by the separation of the University of Dundee from Saint Andrews in 1967, and the establishment then of a legal quirk that prevented St. Andrews from awarding clinical medical degrees. Our internationally leading School of Medicine has since delivered a unique preclinical programme with further medical training completed a partner institutions. That legal restriction was removed in March 2021 when the Scottish Parliament unanimously passed the University of Saint Andrews degrees in medicine and dentistry bill, restoring our capacity to award medical degrees. Students today will graduate with the degree of Bachelor of Science as part of our standard preclinical training program. This historic ceremony will also see the implementation of our renewed awarding powers when we bestow medical degrees jointly with the University of Dundee upon the first cohort of scholars graduating from our Scott GEM programme, Scott Gem or Scottish graduate entry Medicine is a pioneering 4 year course specifically tailored to train the next generation of medical practitioners and with respect for the priorities of the National Health Service. It is taught, taught jointly by the universities of Saint Andrews and Dundee in partnership with the University of the Highlands and Islands while drawing also upon the broader strengths of the Scottish higher education sector. That scoop recognises Scott Gems particular focus on training future general practitioners who are cognizant of the healthcare needs of rural communities and equipped with the will and capacity to improve provision. In recognizing the thoroughly collaborative nature of this programme and the joint degree award with the University of Dundee, I am delighted to welcome guests from our partner universities to today's ceremony and in particular the principal and Vice Chancellor of the University of Dundee, Professor Ian Gillespie, the principal and Vice Chancellor of the University of of the Highlands and Islands. Professor Todd Walker and the chief medical officer for Scotland professor Sir Gregor Smith. I am pleased also to recognise the presence of the University of Dundees Mace amongst the six maces surrounding the Chancellor. The University of Saint Andrews, maces, of which there are seven in total former collection that is unrivaled by any other university and they appear on rotation at the ceremonies as they have for as long as graduation has occurred at Saint Andrews. Three of them present today. The Mace of the Faculty of Arts, the Mace of the Faculty of Canon Law, and the Mace of Saint Salvator's College. Date to the 15th century, and they're joined today by two of our more recent maces, the Mesa, the School of Medicine, presented by an anonymous donor in 1949. And the university Mace acquired in 1958, the University of Dundee, Mass, which at this particular ceremony today is sitting alongside our own in recognition of the collaborative nature of today's celebration was created in 1911 and has been used at every Dundee graduation ceremony since 1968. Medical training throughout our history has been enriched and strengthened by collaboration. Scott Gem draws its power from the coalition of our Excellence and expertise with those of our partner institutions and today's inaugural cohort serves as a shining example of the rewards to be reaped through collaboration. Returning now to today's ceremonies and the rituals which connect us to our forebears. The first of these you have already witnessed as since Sylvatus Chapel Choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald Mccuen delivered the opening prayer. As principal it is my happy duty to welcome you all, after which the presentation of degrees by the Chancellor, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem will commence. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony, and degrees are conferred both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition. The Chancellor will call upon the Deans intern to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and he will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts and to symbolise this, I place upon you this cap. To most though, the Chancellor will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduand. This academic cap has been used at every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our academic community. When the Conferrals are complete, since our Vegas Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innis Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates. Wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is professor Katie Stevenson, Vice Principal for collections, music and digital content. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So while you were graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St. Andre and throughout your life. The canoes faculty Artis medicinale.

You know where to get it, how much it will cost, and so on. Alcohol enjoyed by many, including in has a huge negative impact on individuals and society. Acutely it's associated with injury and sometimes death. Chronically it causes social destruction and domestic harm, liver failure, and cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatitis, many neurological problems, and an increased risk of many other cancers. It affects the unborn fetus amongst the many others secondarily affected by those who drink inappropriately. Ian as a practicing gastroenterologist and Hepatologist, saw this on a daily basis. And he used his positions, most notably as president of the Royal College of Physicians, to increase awareness of these issues and to change policy. Policy response to established public Health Science is tough and takes a long time. Look at smoking. The smoking ban took in the region of 40 years from established fact to policy. Ian has undertaken this long route for alcohol misuse and it is greatly to his credit. In 2007 he an established the Alcohol Health Alliance and continues to chair this. His established the Centre for Alcohol Research at the University of Liverpool, though he admits to never having held an academic post he has enjoyed tinkering with research as he puts it, but I think it's been rather more than that. He admits that no country has got the policy on alcohol right? Prohibition in the United States of America did not work and is not realistic. He emphasises the French policy of a total ban on broadcast and sports sponsorship. And this is one that seems sensible. In Sweden he notes that all outlets of sale are under strict government control, and in both these countries these measures seem to have had beneficial effect. He feels the Scottish Government policy different from England of minimum unit pricing and the restrictions of time of sale. Time of sale may have benefit, but some of these sadly have been lost during the COVID pandemic. What he's keen to emphasize is we must change the whole dialogue on alcohol. Deflate the heroic view of drinking and move society to a better place. This is embodied in his approaches to stakeholders through the Alcohol Health Alliance. Suriyan is the embodiment of a medical practitioner who wants to make a difference. He will have done that through his daily practice. Which, incidentally, he continued whilst he was president of the Royal College of Physicians. But beyond that, he saw that he had opportunities to make changes in public health. In public health policy. Today as we graduate medical students again after a 50 year pause, his example is one that should guide all our graduates, but particularly our medical graduates. Use your qualifications, training and privilege to make a difference. Sir Ian certainly has Chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to medicine. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Medicine on Oris Cowser on Professor Sir Ian Gilmore. Taylor, Graham Doctoris Medicinae on noras kaza from movio. Could you spray in symbolum supertek hope we retain manpower. Chancellor Vice Chancellor Dean and all those others here who have made today such a wonderful success at very big thank you. It's customary to say a few words on these occasions. It's personally a great honour and and joy to me and I have some connections with with this university that were unknown to those who awarded me this degree. They did not know that my father was sitting where you are in 1935 and became a medical doctor and managed to live for another 70 years. So there's hope for you all. They didn't know that I was delivered into this world by an obstetrician in Dundee, who was the first female professor in the University of Saint Andrews. Professor Margaret Fairley. So I was in touch literally as well as metaphorically with the university from an early age. A big thank you to the university for giving me this honor. It's customary to say a few words in the new graduates. You're no longer graduands you're graduates. And these will be particularly directed towards the medical graduates here. And it's an absolute pleasure to be here on the 1st occasion in 50 years that the medical primary medical degree has been given and also the time that this wonderful Scott Gem project has come to fruition. And I really look forward to looking at the progress it makes over the coming years. And the difference it makes, particularly in the Highlands and the Highlands. So some advice to you all. Well, I think as someone who never planned anything in this career, I think the most important advice is be lucky. The other thing I would say is and it's easy to forget this in the heat of a medical take at 2:00 in the morning. Overburdened, understaffed, but remember the privilege it is to be a doctor. It is a real privilege that patients will unburden themselves of their most secret fears, concerns, worries, symptoms and put their trust in you to do something about it. It is a privilege. It's all too easy to forget. But all too important to remember. Beyond that, I would like to say that as I've been called, sometimes the alcohol guru. My advice to you is forget about the limits tonight, but return. That was very cool. It's. But please return to them tomorrow. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Sorry, I beg your pardon. As you were. I haven't been following. The honorary graduates advice I can assure you. With my. Embarrassment very fully available. I call upon the principle of the university. It was a long day yesterday. I call upon Katie Stevenson, the vice principal for collections, music, and digital content in order to deliver the graduation address. Chancellor's principal distinguished guests and graduates of the University of Saint Andrews. On behalf of my colleagues here on the stage and all of those at the university, I'm honoured to be the first to say to you, congratulations. It's my duty today to say some words that you'll find meaningful and reflect the mood of the graduation ritual. It's unlikely you're gonna remember anything I've said by suppertime because today is really too thrilling. Filled with excitement, pride and that knowingly nostalgic feeling when one moves through a ritual ending and says goodbye. To everything that has passed and looks ahead to something else. A different beginning that will bring trepidation, challenges, discomfort, uncertainty, and, across time. More learning growth, failures, and accomplishments. As a cohort, you two will remember with fondness your arrival at this university, having crossed a similar threshold. When you left your last milestone and came here bright, excited, and ready to take every opportunity that this new life offered to you. I hope you did. I commend you for the way in which you face challenges. Never before known in the history of university education. When you studied at home and met your friends on a screen, in some cases unable to do the very actions which attracted you to a future in health and Medical Sciences in the 1st place, the comforting of someone in pain with a touch of your hand. That you have emerged as graduates through this time is a stupendous achievement, and one which we are all, your family, your loved ones, your lecturers and tutors, and your friends extraordinarily impressed. I'm an historian, that's why I'm quite wordy. A discipline which reflects on how people understand and write about the events which they have experienced, and how memory changes, distorts, recreates, or disappears over time. In the coming days and weeks, spend some time reflecting on your university years and on the pandemic in particular. You will already have noticed that as the immediacy of its effects have diminished, we are quick to forget what we experienced. Do not lose the opportunity to remind yourself of your history. To take stock of the lessons you have learned, remind yourself of the people who have influenced or impacted upon you and celebrate that who you were when you arrived at Saint Andrews is leaving Saint Andrews as someone a little older who knows a lot more and who has experienced intensive challenges that brought you remarkable resilience. In the 2018 book The Coddling of the American Mind, the authors quoted from a speech that the then Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts had delivered just a year earlier. Invited to give the commencement address at a middle school, Roberts used this as an opportunity to make a plea for resilience in a generation which he saw as being too fragile and inexperienced with the real demands of contributing positively to adult society. And I'm I'm going to quote from his speech. Historians are inclined to quote length when someone captures an essential truth in their words. So bear with me. It's worth it. I quote from time to time in the years to come. I hope you will be treated unfairly so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal, because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will that you will be lonely from time to time so that you don't take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck again from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not entirely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you'll be ignored so that you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they're going to happen, and whether you benefit from them or not will depend on your ability to see the message in your misfortunes. Now I do not follow Robert's position entirely and I do not wish these things for you. You are not 11 and you've not just started on your middle and high school journeys and you have already experienced these things and likely often. But I would like you to remember as you navigate the next steps of your lives, that whilst you have, I hope, just experienced the most challenging years of those lives to date, far more challenging than any of us could have anticipated that life will continue to challenge you, and that in that challenge will come the opportunity to learn to grow and to continue to pursue a life of worthwhile contribution. Over 600 years ago, when the university was first founded, the historian Walter Bauer described the celebrations of the townspeople of Saint Andrews University teachers and students as they came together in celebration on a day not unlike today, there was boundless merrymaking large bonfires burning in the streets, and, as tradition may prove, a lot of wine was consumed. Bauer also observed again. I quote some people think that there is one thing in the university in recent times that is not only reprehensible but also needs changing, not referring to the wine, namely that when students begin to learn and obtain degrees, they soon leave and thus demean the learning which ought to distinguish them. Bower thought that students should learn at university and then stay on to teach others and contemplate philosophically the problems the world faced not to go out into the world to take their knowledge and skills with them to other organisations. Whilst my colleagues and I are here on the stage, have followed Bowers preferred path, you will all be relieved to hear that we are actually delighted that having obtained your degree, you will definitely be leaving. But do take Bowers point to heart, do not demean your learning. Rather let your learning distinguish you in your career. Graduation addresses are by their very nature, a moment for the university to give something of a a celebratory push out of the nest today as a graduate of this ancient university, you stand as a credit to yourself. We hope that what's in Andrews has provided for you will give you the knowledge, the wisdom and the resilience to succeed, to prosper, to make a worthwhile contribution to society and to be happy ever to excel. That was some diffidence. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas Day at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum, Amen. And."
