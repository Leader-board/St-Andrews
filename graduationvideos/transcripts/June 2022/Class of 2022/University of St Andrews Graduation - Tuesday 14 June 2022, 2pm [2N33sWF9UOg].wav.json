ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape the modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five olders still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteen issued paper balls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met with great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bower a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of fifteenth century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history the scotty chronicon which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that saint rule was born in circa three hundred AD and was a bishop in patras greece and he was visited one evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint louis brought the relics which constituted one tooth one kneecap one humorous and saint andrew 's right hand to what bower describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation 's patron saint the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued saint andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its six hundred years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the fifteenth century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in fourteen seventy nine and fourteen ninety four respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas 's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar 's poetry was amongst the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in fifteen oh eight and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin ennead into scots completing this in fifteen thirteen these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university which included one who would become principal of saint leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the sixth of scotland and he served as a herd at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in fifteen sixty five later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin poetry deliciae potara M scoutorama was sponsored by graduate an early philanthropist of our university john scott in sixteen thirty seven and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from fifteen sixty five to as sorry from seventeen sixty five to seventeen sixty eight and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by william mure an early female graduate of our university in nineteen ten who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that the muers perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today host some of the world 's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OB professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose contribution of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalise upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since larvatus chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudi armas and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i am invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or ferratum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour sarah mccauley brown to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor stephen gethins from the school of international relations the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so while you were graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus facultades alsum vice chancellor i ask you to confer the degree of master of arts general in absentia on cameron simpson am absentee magistrum

calls have preview cuisery and symbolum superette hope brayton imponent congratulations thank you so much and what an honor it is to be here at the university of saint andrews the real privilege is for me to be present here with you to see you collect your degrees after your years of hard work and academic study endured through some of the worst parts of the pandemic and lockdown so i do hope that you've also found a way to have some fun along the way too what an amazing place it is to come and study here at saint andrews in fife i first came to fife as a child each time my family came back on leave from our home in tanzania i remember so clearly this was the first time i ever saw snow after living in east africa later when i lived in london we would still keep coming to fife each summer and of course i've ended up marrying a fifer and have made my home here for more than last for the last twenty two years i hope that wherever you come from and wherever you find yourself as your life unfolds and your career unfolds you'll always feel a connection here and find occasion to return as well now you're all going forward into a world that is changing rapidly and while we're all recalibrating the way that we live and work as we merge from the restrictions of the pandemic you know that it's your education at one of the best universities in the world i think you'd probably all say the best university in the world that unquestionably provides you with the opportunities that lie ahead for you that give you a solid foundation the abilities and the confidence to take it forwards i lead a nonprofit their world that's focused on how we solve the global education crisis how we deliver education and excuse me and on the global promise that we made via the united nations for the two hundred and sixty million children who miss out on an education if we're to realise the united nations sustainable development goals that lie at the heart of the future of our planet to reduce poverty to tackle climate change to achieve gender equality and other equalities to provide nutrition healthcare water sanitation for everyone i believe and have dedicated my efforts through their world 's work and achievements to date that everyone must have access to a decent education to realise those goals the solutions to poverty reduction to climate action to quality healthcare are as much as much as important as the economic drivers of our society the jobs and skills for the future all of this comes from everyone's education that two hundred and sixty million children still meet at miss out on the chance of an education around the world is something that we all have a part to play in addressing each of your actions to help someone else to sign a petition to contact a political leader to share your own funds as you go forward with your careers all of that adds up as you go forward to reach your own potential remember that unlocking and fulfilling the potential of each of us is what provides a better world for all of us i believe passionately that we must ensure that every child and young person has the best start in life a safe place to learn and the skills for the future we have to unlock big change to reach everyone i wish you all a wonderful future ahead as you move to your next adventure and congratulations on your university of saint andrews degree i call upon professor stephen gethins of the school of international relations vice chancellor colleagues special guests and most of all graduates it's my great pleasure and privilege to address you our new graduates today and also our honorary graduate today as well today's graduation ceremony presents an opportunity for us at the university to join with your friends and family to mark your hard work and achievements as we celebrate with you so before i go on any further well done congratulations on everything that you've achieved i hope you don't mind me saying there's added poignancy to our celebration this year this is saint andrew 's first summer graduation since two thousand and nineteen and well over two years since the pandemic claimed its first victims and locked down touched us all and i know that a lot of you here today will be thinking about the impact that this has had on you but also on loved ones friends and family as well this uniquely difficult set of circumstances that each of you has overcome to be here today i think makes your achievement even more special graduations i'm afraid provide the briefest of pauses before you head out to make your mark on the world as generations of graduates from this university have done in the past and will do in the future and for centuries the world around us has benefited and been enhanced by the insights expertise and innovation provided by graduates of the university and i'm absolutely confident that you will prove no different from that legacy it's a world that is in badly need of your ideas and fresh thinking as we face significant challenges that will shape the lives of your generation but also generations to come and in a time of unique challenges it's also one of unique opportunity the pandemics been devastating for life 's livelihoods physical and mental well being and whilst acknowledging that we must also take the chance to look at what can be learned from these past two years especially in areas such as tackling unfairness and inequality including the new disparities that have emerged during this unique time russia 's war of aggression in ukraine also tells us that peace and security can never be taken for granted the war has brought once again devastation to europe touching friends and colleagues here at the university just as war has also done so in places like yemen syria afghanistan and unfortunately far too many places to mention from the ashes of conflict we have the opportunity to revisit what it means to build security dignity and prosperity for everyone and we mustn't lose sight of the work that needs to be done to tackle the climate emergency and living with its consequences that means innovation and it means learning to do things better that's a mammoth challenge but also like every mammoth challenge provides a significant opportunity as well so like those who have gone before facing up to these issues and more besides will rely on you and your ideas for building a better world and making that reality will depend on you being able to be to debate what is best in a spirit of respect and productivity that is and always has been the best way to make progress i sometimes get a little bit frustrated with the remark being person or during an online debate that i had disguised people say i disagree with almost everything you believe in but actually for those of us who believe in democratic values respect for one another the spirit of friendly debate then our values give us far more in common than sometimes during these debates we concede so where we do disagree we must do so with respect for it is through productive debate and discussion and seeking to understand different perspectives that we'll learn to ensure good ideas become even better if we agreed all of the time then not only would we feel in our duty to make progress but frankly life would be pretty dull as well so remember wherever you go and whatever you do you will always be welcome and have a home here remember too that we're relying on you to build a world that meets today's challenges of war inequality and environmental degradation i know that you'll be up for meeting those challenges and finding the opportunities so finally congratulations and i so much look forward to reading and hearing about everything that you achieve in the years to come congratulations item please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular orum ahmed",

kneecap 1 humorous and saint andrew's right hand to what bower describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation's patron st the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued st andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its 600 years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in 1479 and 1494 respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar's poetry was amongst the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in 1508 and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin ennead into scots completing this in 1513 these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university which included one who would become principal of st leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the 6th of scotland and he served as a herd at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in 1565 later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin poetry deliciae potara M scoutorama was sponsored by graduate an early philanthropist of our university john scott in 1637 and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from 1565 to as sorry from 1765 to 1768 and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by william mure an early female graduate of our university in 1910 who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that the muers perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today host some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OB professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose

imponent congratulations thank you so much and what an honor it is to be here at the university of saint andrews the real privilege is for me to be present here with you to see you collect your degrees after your years of hard work and academic study endured through some of the worst parts of the pandemic and lockdown so i do hope that you've also found a way to have some fun along the way too what an amazing place it is to come and study here at saint andrews in fife i first came to fife as a child each time my family came back on leave from our home in tanzania i remember so clearly this was the first time i ever saw snow after living in east africa later when i lived in london we would still keep coming to fife each summer and of course i've ended up marrying a fifer and have made my home here for more than last for the last 22 years i hope that wherever you come from and wherever you find yourself as your life unfolds and your career unfolds you'll always feel a connection here and find occasion to return as well now you're all going forward into a world that is changing rapidly and while we're all recalibrating the way that we live and work as we merge from the restrictions of the pandemic you know that it's your education at one of the best universities in the world i think you'd probably all say the best university in the world that unquestionably provides you with the opportunities that lie ahead for you that give you a solid foundation the abilities and the confidence to take it forwards i lead a nonprofit their world that's focused on how we solve the global education crisis how we deliver education and excuse me and on the global promise that we made via the united nations for the 260 million children who miss out on an education if we're to realise the united nations sustainable development goals that lie at the heart of the future of our planet to reduce poverty to tackle climate change to achieve gender equality and other equalities to provide nutrition healthcare water sanitation for everyone i believe and have dedicated my efforts through their world's work and achievements to date that everyone must have access to a decent education to realise those goals the solutions to poverty reduction to climate action to quality healthcare are as much as much as important as the economic drivers of our society the jobs and skills for the future all of this comes from everyone's education that 260 million children still meet at miss out on the chance of an education around the world is something that we all have a part to play in addressing each of your actions to help someone else to sign a petition to contact a political leader to share your own funds as you go forward with your careers all of that adds up as you go forward to reach your own potential remember that unlocking and fulfilling the potential of each of us is what provides a better world for all of us i believe passionately that we must ensure that every child and young person has the best start in life a safe place to learn and the skills for the future we have to unlock big change to reach everyone i wish you all a wonderful future ahead as you move to your next adventure and congratulations on your university of saint andrews degree i call upon professor stephen gethins of the school of international relations vice chancellor colleagues special guests and most of all graduates it's my great pleasure and privilege to address you our new graduates today and also our honorary graduate today as well today's graduation ceremony presents an opportunity for us at the university to join with your friends and family to mark your hard work and achievements as we celebrate with you so before i go on any further well done congratulations on everything that you've achieved i hope you don't mind me saying there's added poignancy to our celebration this year this is saint andrew's first summer graduation since 2019 and well over two years since the pandemic claimed its first victims and locked down touched us all and i know that a lot of you here today will be thinking about the impact that this has had on you but also on loved ones friends and family as well this uniquely difficult set of circumstances that each of you has overcome to be here today i think makes your achievement even more special graduations i'm afraid provide the briefest of pauses before you head out to make your mark on the world as generations of graduates from this university have done in the past and will do in the future and for centuries the world around us has benefited and been enhanced by the insights expertise and innovation provided by graduates of the university and i'm absolutely confident that you will prove no different from that legacy it's a world that is in badly need of your ideas and fresh thinking as we face significant challenges that will shape the lives of your generation but also generations to come and in a time of unique challenges it's also one of unique opportunity the pandemics been devastating for life's livelihoods physical and mental well being and whilst acknowledging that we must also take the chance to look at what can be learned from these past two years especially in areas such as tackling unfairness and inequality including the new disparities that have emerged during this unique time russia's war of aggression in ukraine also tells us that peace and security can never be taken for granted the war has brought once again devastation to europe touching friends and colleagues here at the university just as war has also done so in places like yemen syria afghanistan and unfortunately far too many places to mention from the ashes of conflict we have the opportunity to revisit what it means to build security dignity and prosperity for everyone and we mustn't lose sight of the work that needs to be done to tackle the climate emergency and living with its consequences that means innovation and it means learning to do things better that's a mammoth challenge but also like every mammoth challenge provides a significant opportunity as well so like those who have gone before facing up to these issues and more besides will rely on you and your ideas for building a better world and making that reality will depend on you being able to be to debate what is best in a spirit of respect and productivity that is and always has been the best way to make progress i sometimes get a little bit frustrated with the remark being person or during an online debate that i had disguised people say i disagree with almost everything you believe in but actually for those of us who believe in democratic values respect for one another the spirit of friendly debate then our values give us far more in common than sometimes during these debates we concede so where we do disagree we must do so with respect for it is through productive debate and discussion and seeking to understand different perspectives that we'll learn to ensure good ideas become even better if we agreed all of the time then not only would we feel in our duty to make progress but frankly life would be pretty dull as well so remember wherever you go and whatever you do you will always be welcome and have a home here remember too that we're relying on you to build a world that meets today's challenges of war inequality and environmental degradation i know that you'll be up for meeting those challenges and finding the opportunities so finally congratulations and i so much look forward to reading and hearing about everything that you achieve in the years to come congratulations item please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri jesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti

It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. I am particularly pleased also to welcome our guests from the College of William and Mary in Virginia, who join us today to celebrate the class graduating from our. Innovative joint degree program. the BA International honours. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape the modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 olders still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled. The pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict, the 13, issued paper balls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met with great jubilation when carried into town the following February. Walter Bower, a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th Century Scotland, described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of Scottish History, the Scotty Chronicon, which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination. Legend has it that St Rule was born in circa 300 AD and was a Bishop in Patras, Greece. And he was visited 1 evening by an Angel who instructed him to take the bones of Saint Andrew far from the reach of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. Saint Louis brought the relics, which constituted one tooth, 1 kneecap 1 humorous and Saint Andrew's right hand to what Bower describes as the island situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun. And it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in Saint Andrews. Which have proven so formative for contemporary Scotland, developed with Saint Andrew, later becoming the nation's patron St. The lyrical origins of our town and university imbued St. Andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a Crucible for literary creativity. Throughout its 600 years, Walter Bowers Mantle was assumed by two alumni. Later in the 15th century, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas, who graduated in 1479 and 1494, respectively. And who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern Scotland? Dunbar, and Douglas's use of Scots was foundational for much literature that followed. Dunbar's poetry was amongst the first items printed in Scotland by the Edinburgh Printers, Chapman and Miller in 1508, and Douglas was the first translator of VERGIL'S Latin Ennead into Scots. Completing this in 1513. These were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university, which included one who would become principal of St. Leonards College, George Buchanan. The most significant Latin poet of his time. Buchanan was amongst many occupations, a tutor to Mary, Queen of Scots, and later King James, the 6th of Scotland, and he served as a herd at Mary's Court, in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks, including a special Commission for the wedding of Mary to Lord Darnley in 1565. Later generations were equally influential. The first major printed anthology of Scottish Latin poetry deliciae Potara M Scoutorama was sponsored. By graduate, an early philanthropist of our university, John Scott in 1637. And while we cannot claim to have educated Robert Burns who lived degree less to his end days, Saint Andrews was the academic home of the Scottish poet Robert Ferguson, who studied here from 1565 to as sorry from 1765 to 1768, and whom Burns held in higher esteem than all other writers. Literary life thrived in more recent centuries, and literary translation in particular was taken up by William Mure, an early female graduate of our university in 1910, who with her husband Edwin, translated works by such luminaries as Herman Brooke and Franz Kafka. The literary culture that the muers perpetuated complemented the research activities of our School of English, which today host some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners. We are highly distinctive in accommodating poets, dramatists and creatives, including Professor Don Patterson, OB Professor John Burnside, and Professor Zinnie Harris, whose contribution of creative ingenuity with critical rigour. Capitalise upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears. The first of these you have already witnessed as since Larvatus Chapel Choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudi Armas and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor. Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and I am invested with the authority to award degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates for degrees from their respective faculties, and I will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this cap to most, though I will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or ferratum touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our. Alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, since our veterans Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Sarah McCauley brown. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates. Wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Professor Stephen Gethins from the School of International Relations. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So while you were graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience.

I call upon Professor Ali Watson of the School of International Relations. Vice Chancellor, I have the honor to present for the degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris causa Sarah McCauley Brown. Sarah Brown is someone who spends her life on the things that matter. Whether in her global campaigning for better health, outcomes for mothers and babies, or for improved educational opportunities for children and young people, Sarah Brown has taken the wide ranging skills developed during a career as a communications expert and businesswoman to truly marry the fields of advocacy of philanthropy and of social justice. Born in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, Sarah Brown spent part of her young childhood in Tanzania, East Africa with annual trips back to family here in Fife and in Edinburgh. When she subsequently returned to the UK, it was to north London and to school there. Prior to embarking on a psychology degree at Bristol University and then on to highly successful career in design and public relations. That included becoming managing director, director of one of Britain's most dynamic independent communications companies and subsequently leading a global arts PR firm that specialises in clients working on social causes. Sarah's fundamental belief that all of us have a part to play in driving forward change soon led her to make the move from working with organisations with the social focus to creating them herself. In 2002, Sierra founded the charity of Piggy Bank Kids with the aim of supporting scientific and community research to help give kids across the UK the best possible chance to live happy and healthy lives. This included the establishment of the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory, based at the University of Edinburgh, whose advances in maternal health and newborn care continue to save lives every day. Piggybank kids subsequently became their world, a global charity that Sierra cheers and that is committed to addressing the global education crisis and building opportunity for future generations. This includes their global youth Ambassador program, which supports young people and developing the skills they need to be able to address educational change at both the local and the global level. As Sarah herself says, every child everywhere deserves a safe place to learn. In 2016, their world led a campaign driven by an 11 million signature petition to support funding for education during emergencies, whilst an innovative approach to schooling double shift schools has allowed hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugee children to access education. At the same time as chairing their world's operations, Sarah also serves as executive chair of the Global Business Coalition for Education, bringing together more than 100 companies from across the globe to work for better quality education for the world's children and youth. Sarah also continues her support and advocacy for numerous other organizations, including Maggies, Cancer Caring Centres and Shine Education Trust and Education Charity. Working with teachers, schools and other organisations to help disadvantaged children in the north of England fulfill their true potential. In addition, she is also a writer, the host of the podcast, Better Angels and added Tweeter and a mum. Feist counselor in recognition of her major contribution as a campaigner and advocate for better global health and education, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Laws on Norris Kaiser on Sarah McCauley Brown. Tea. At grade and Doctoris Legum honoris calls have preview Cuisery and Symbolum Superette Hope Brayton, Imponent. Congratulations. Thank you so much and what an honor it is to be here at the University of Saint Andrews. The real privilege is for me to be present here with you to see you collect your degrees after your years of hard work and academic study endured through some of the worst parts of the pandemic and lockdown. So I do hope that you've also found a way to have some fun. Along the way too. What an amazing place it is to come and study here at Saint Andrews in Fife. I first came to Fife as a child. Each time my family came back on leave from our home in Tanzania. I remember so clearly this was the first time I ever saw snow after living in East Africa. Later, when I lived in London, we would still keep coming to Fife each summer and of course I've ended up marrying a fifer and have made my home here for more than last for the last 22 years. I hope that wherever you come from and wherever you find yourself as your life unfolds and your career unfolds, you'll always feel a connection here and find occasion to return as well. Now you're all going forward into a world that is changing rapidly. And while we're all recalibrating the way that we live and work as we merge from the restrictions of the pandemic, you know that it's your education at one of the best universities in the world. I think you'd probably all say the best university in the world that unquestionably provides you with the opportunities that lie ahead for you that give you a solid foundation, the abilities, and the confidence to take it forwards. I lead a nonprofit their world that's focused on how we solve the global education crisis, how we deliver education and excuse me, and on the global promise that we made via the United Nations for the 260 million children who miss out on an education. If we're to realise the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that lie at the heart of the future of our planet to reduce poverty, to tackle climate change, to achieve gender equality and other equalities. To provide nutrition, healthcare, water, sanitation for everyone I believe and have dedicated my efforts through their world's work and achievements to date that everyone must have access to a decent education to realise those goals. The solutions to poverty reduction to climate action to quality healthcare are as much as much as important as the economic drivers of our society. The jobs and skills for the future. All of this comes from everyone's education that 260 million children still meet at miss out on the chance of an education around the world is something that we all have a part to play in addressing. Each of your actions to help someone else to sign a petition to contact a political leader to share your own funds as you go forward with your careers. All of that adds up. As you go forward to reach your own potential, remember that unlocking and fulfilling the potential of each of us is what provides a better world for all of us. I believe passionately that we must ensure that every child and young person has the best start in life. A safe place to learn and the skills for the future. We have to unlock big change to reach everyone. I wish you all a wonderful future ahead as you move to your next adventure. And congratulations on your University of Saint Andrews degree. I call upon Professor Stephen Gethins of the School of International Relations. Vice Chancellor, colleagues, special guests and most of all, graduates. It's my great pleasure and privilege to address you. Our new graduates today and also our honorary graduate today as well. Today's graduation ceremony presents an opportunity for us at the university to join with your friends and family to mark your hard work and achievements as we celebrate with you. So before I go on any further, well done congratulations on everything that you've achieved. I hope you don't mind me saying there's added poignancy to our celebration this year. This is Saint Andrew's first summer graduation since 2019 and well over two years since the pandemic claimed its first victims and locked down touched us all. And I know that a lot of you here today will be thinking about the impact that this has had on you, but also on loved ones. Friends and family as well. This uniquely difficult set of circumstances that each of you has overcome to be here today I think makes your achievement even more special. Graduations I'm afraid provide the briefest of pauses before you head out to make your mark on the world as generations of graduates from this university have done in the past and will do in the future. And for centuries, the world around us has benefited and been enhanced by the insights, expertise and innovation provided by graduates of the university. And I'm absolutely confident that you will prove no different from that legacy. It's a world that is in badly need of your ideas and fresh thinking as we face significant challenges that will shape the lives of your generation but also generations to come. And in a time of unique challenges, it's also one of unique opportunity. The pandemics been devastating for life's livelihoods, physical and mental well being. And whilst acknowledging that we must also take the chance to look at what can be learned from these past two years, especially in areas such as tackling unfairness and inequality, including the new disparities that have emerged during this unique time. Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine also tells us that peace and security can never be taken for granted. The war has brought once again devastation to Europe touching friends and colleagues here at the university. Just as war has also done so in places like Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, and unfortunately far too many places to mention. From the ashes of conflict, we have the opportunity to revisit what it means to build security, dignity and prosperity for everyone. And we mustn't lose sight of the work that needs to be done to tackle the climate emergency and living with its consequences. That means innovation, and it means learning to do things better. That's a mammoth challenge, but also like every mammoth, challenge provides a significant opportunity as well. So like those who have gone before. Facing up to these issues and more besides, will rely on you and your ideas for building a better world and making that reality will depend on you being able to be to debate what is best in a spirit of respect and productivity that is and always has been the best way to make progress. I sometimes get a little bit frustrated with the remark being person or during an online debate that I had disguised. People say I disagree with almost everything you believe in, but. Actually, for those of us who believe in democratic values, respect for one another, the spirit of friendly debate, then our values give us far more in common than sometimes during these debates we concede. So where we do disagree, we must do so with respect for it is through productive debate and discussion and seeking to understand different perspectives that we'll learn to ensure good ideas become even better. If we agreed all of the time, then not only would we feel in our duty to make progress. But frankly, life would be pretty dull as well. So remember wherever you go and whatever you do, you will always be welcome and have a home here. Remember too that we're relying on you to build a world that meets today's challenges of war, inequality, and environmental degradation. I know that you'll be up for meeting those challenges and finding the opportunities. So finally, congratulations and I so much look forward to reading and hearing about everything that you achieve in the years to come. Congratulations. Item. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secular Orum Ahmed."
