sanctum nomen tuum glorified keymas at misericordia tua vitam itanium consequent periosteum christum dominum nostrum ahmed please be seated good morning everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall was closed in july two thousand and nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of this ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteen thirteenth issued papal bills from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later of the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king rob at the third and later as tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for eighteen years king james revisited saint andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas here in fourteen twenty five and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the sixth of scotland and first of england visited saint andrews in sixteen seventeen and made a gift of two hundred volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in sixteen forty three on south street this was a key moment for the early library but one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous events earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary's college from fifteen eighty and as rector from fifteen ninety melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to locky of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national lives throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen 's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in two thousand and five we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may twenty twenty one and earlier this week we unveiled a fortieth birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the universities wardlaw museum our recently redeveloped museum situated on the scores which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and change makers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fife to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is one from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the dean to present candidates for degrees from their faculty and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete i shall then make a special presentation of the principles medal and award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to one of our graduates the principal 's medal will today be bestowed upon salma ali of the school of biology since our theaters chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour doctor richard henderson to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor russell morris from the school of chemistry the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so while you are graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus

ede and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and robe makers in the world the award of the principal 's medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year twenty twenty one to twenty twenty two the principal 's medal is being awarded to two outstanding students today today we recognise salma ali who has just received the degree of master of biochemistry with honours and i'm pleased to note that she received a very strong first class degree salma 's nomination references her formidable intellectual accomplishments she made the deans list for outstanding academic achievement in every year of study and she has just graduated with one of the most distinguished academic profiles of her entire class some was nominator rights that she can and i quote be ranked among the very best students ever to have taken a biological degree at the university of saint andrews salma 's excellence in the classroom has been replicated in professional environments and her degree programme incorporated a one year external placement which she spent in the cell line development team at astrazeneca in cambridge last academic year a competitive option and one which resulted in an acclaimed undergraduate dissertation samba has undertaking undertaken other external non credit bearing research placements as an amgen scholar at the karolinska institute in stockholm sweden in twenty nineteen as a research assistant in a neurogenetics lab at our university in the twenty nineteen to twenty twenty academic year and for the past year as a researcher under the supervision of the head of the school of biology professor frank gumm moore it is the synergy of her remarkable theoretical comprehension with her fluency in professional environments that led to salma 's nominator concluding and i quote again that salma is amongst the most gifted undergraduate students that i have ever encountered in over thirty years of teaching at UC berkeley the university of cambridge and the university of saint andrews such attainments are laudable in their own right but they dazzle when contextualised by the breadth of salma 's other contributions to our university particularly her support for fostering diverse and inclusive academic environments in the twenty nineteen to twenty twenty academic year some will participated in the global challenges programme as a researcher and strategist answering the question how can we make saint andrews a beacon of inclusivity not only did salma win the programme but she has since consolidated her fine her findings by cofounding and chairing the bane biology team within our school of biology in twenty twenty a network of students and researchers that organises activities designed to promote anti racist and inclusive cultures and which has been recognised as best practice and replicated in other schools some served also as a member of the school of biologies equality diversity and inclusion committee and in twenty twenty one she joined the EDI advisory panel of the biochemical society an international learned society and on which panel she is the only student member salma models excellence while embodying a generous inclusive and passionate outlook that is an inspiration to her peers and tutors alike salma in recognition of your many accomplishments both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate it gives me very great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal 's medal three party i call upon professor malcolm white of the school of biology vice chancellor it's my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science on orders coza doctor richard henderson to understand the world around us we need to observe it in the seventeenth century anthony van levenhuk built his own light microscopes and he opened up a new world of biology in a drop of water in the twentieth century structural biologists developed the use of X rays to visualize proteins and DNA in atomic detail revealing the secrets of the machinery of life and heralding a golden age of molecular biology today we honour richard henderson who pioneered the use of electrons to study biological structures an advance that's catalyzing another step change in our ability to see and to understand richard 's childhood was spent in the scottish borders and he attended edinburgh university to read physics his interest turned towards the new discipline of molecular biology and he contributed to early advances in X ray crystallography during his PHD at the laboratory of molecular biology or LB in cambridge while working as a postdoctoral researcher at yale richard developed an interest in solving the structures of membrane proteins these were and still are very difficult to study with X rays and richard turned a turn to the alternative of using electrons which caused much less damage to biological samples returning to the L M P L B richard devoted to scientific career to the development of the technique of electron microscopy this must have required astonishing levels of perseverance as the crystallographers made great strides and electron microscopy was often viewed as a poor relation and starved of funding however perseverance is one of the key qualities scientists need and advances in sample preparation data collection and analysis over decades have communicated in the realisation of richard 's vision over the past ten years electron microscopy has created another step change in our ability to see the world around us revolutionizing the field of molecular biology and in addition to its fundamental importance the ability to visualize these biological structures at atomic resolution opens the door to many new treatments for human disease amongst numerous awards richard shared the nobel prize in chemistry in twenty seventeen characteristically when he got the call from stockholm he was in a research seminar and so he rejected it the call now the prize vice chancellor and recognition of his seminal contribution to the development of the field of electron microscopy i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science on oris koza on doctor richard henderson tay at gradam torres ciencia honoris causa from review libelium superette hope vratham imponer congratulations so i'll just say a few words thanking saint andrews for my award and perhaps on behalf of the others with one brief little story so my i first came to saint andrews in nineteen sixty five so that's sort of fifty seven years ago and i was an undergraduate at edinburgh university doing physics and like saint andrews we had lots of societies that undergraduates did extracurricular activities one of them was edinburgh university photographic society photo sock and one one day we brought a the results of the international exhibition from edinburgh fotostock to saint andrews fotostock and we did the exhibition and were welcomed by the equivalent people in saint andrews and treated us very well so that's my first memory i'm very fond memories of that time and so this is now another event to remember in terms of the associations with saint andrew so i'd like to just say thank you big thank you new vice chancellor and to malcolm for this degree and for welcome me and i have to say it's much less work than the effort that you people have put into getting your degree so thank you very very much i call upon bishop ward law professor russell morris of the school of chemistry butch chancellor on a guests graduates of saint andrews wow don't you look good what a sight for sure i'd i'd completely forgotten what it looked like to stand here and and see happy smiling faces at a graduation ceremony you look great this is a day to be proud first and foremost you should be proud of your own achievements it's been a tricky time to be a student let's face it the last couple of years and i i salute not only your academic skills but also your resilience i truly hope that whatever memories you take away from saint andrews it'll be of your friends and not the pandemic and it won't have spoiled anything about about your time here my colleagues and i we couldn't be prouder of all your achievements indeed i think there's only one set of people prouder than we are and that is all your supporters friends and family sitting here in the audience watching on the internet watching the DVD if it's still a DVD you may right you should spare a moment now to silently or loudly if you prefer thank them for their support over the years you now have one of the great degrees and i'll come back later on to exactly how great a saint andrews degree is but first a little bit of advice most of you here today are science may be some social science graduates and i will i will talk specifically about specifically about science but it translates equally well to all the degrees from saint andrews even to the pesky classics degrees which i'll come back to again later i'm a professor of chemistry right and in my office down down the road i'm lucky to have a bookcase that holds what's called the ervin collection the journals and textbooks that sir james irving left to the school of chemistry sir james was a was a was the professor of chemistry who actually ended up being the vice chancellor and principal for thirty plus years actually for a long time he was a fantastic scientist and leader who did so much for the university of saint andrews including having younger hall built where you are today and his name still still sits on the outside of the building it sounded like quite a cool guy actually i particularly enjoy the story of how as principal of the university he found the local colemans family playing cricket on the street he was not having any of that he took them back to the quad outside lower college hall where you'll be in a moment set up a pitch in wicket and bold the bold to them for the rest of the afternoon i think even in the nineteen thirties it would have been a an unusual sight to see the principal coming in off the long run as they say i'll let you ask at the garden party whether our current principle is a demon bowler or not of all those books in the urban collection two of the slimmest volumes of my favourites these are transcripts of lectures that sir james gave during the time he was principal it's a truly fascinating to read his thoughts one delivered in nineteen forty was to celebrate the centenary of the professorship in chemistry at saint andrews our chair the first chair in chemistry was endowed through a request in eighteen oh eight just hold on a minute his lecture was given in nineteen forty sir james at first i wondered what just what it was too busy playing cricket to get around to giving the lecture but actually no he explained all with what i hope was a twinkle in his eye it turns out the classics department stole all the money and so there wasn't any left for a chemistry professor until until eighteen forty so he was right bang on a hundred years as scientists we are magnanimous and gracious and of course we've forgiven the classicists but we don't let them know if we ever have any money the second volume is a series of three lectures given in canada in nineteen thirty seven the subject of the lectures was science and citizenship it is very striking that so james 's thoughts on the challenges of life in the nineteen thirties and the need for science in society are similar in fact one might say scarily similar to today he clearly knew the role that science should play and how every scientist and every graduate needed to take responsibility for ensuring that the public we're engaged with the facts of any discussions it really could have been written for today we're all aware that there are great challenges in our world and that science will have a role to play and we'll play its part in solving them the challenges to illustrate sir james 's view i'd just like to quote a short passage from the second lecture which was entitled science education and the fundamental values my contention is that the altruistic spirit can be fostered by scientific education so that a distinctive habit of mind is formed and the discipline of integrity and responsibility created which find their application in the wider life of the community in other words whatever you end up doing whether it's a pioneer and an academic field or an industrial field or an opera singer or you're taking ditches for the council doesn't actually matter your job now you have left the university of saint andrews those of you who are leaving some of you may be staying now that you're left with the saint andrews degree your job is to use your distinctive habit of mind for the benefit of society be an active participant in the important debates of the day we've all seen how the wonders of modern communication mean that good news and bad fake news and the truth travel quicker than ever in areas like the pandemic recovery or the climate crisis we desperately need a society that is science literate if we're to make the right choices it's your job that's a saint andrews graduate to help sort out the wheat from the chaff do not just believe the last person even if it's me you heard but use the skills you've learned here to evaluate the evidence come to the best possible conclusions and use your education to improve the world speaking of evaluating the evidence i i did promise to come back to the question of how good is a saint andrews degree now i'll use my own skills of evidence evaluation to to i think produce two incontrovertible facts about saint andrews degrees that show how good it really is how good they really are now in doing this you will have to remember that i don't have a degree from saint andrews the colours of this this gown are from an inferior university so i won't be as good as as you wouldn't be as good at it but i'll do my best fact number one the evidence nearly twenty years ago we gave an honorary degree to one highly eminent famous person he came happily sat on the on the stage where doctor henderson is now had a great day a few years later he was awarded the nobel prize for literature this time he pointedly refused to attend this ceremony couldn't be bothered so that's the evidence what conclusion can we come to well i think it's obvious getting the saint andrews degree must be better than winning a nobel prize i can't actually see doctor henderson i'm sure you know that right so that's incontrovertible fact number one what about fact number two OK you ready for this one this is even better what else is great about us and andrew 's degree well fact number two is that you've all got one congratulations have a great day fantastic thank you please stand for the benediction grazia dominique nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus

vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in 1929 the younger hall was closed in july 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the 15th century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of this ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the 12th century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in 1318 university instruction commenced here in may 1410 when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteen 13th issued papal bills from peniscola in august 1413 which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later of the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king rob at the 3rd and later as tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for 18 years king james revisited st andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas here in 1425 and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the 6th of scotland and 1st of england visited st andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in 1643 on south st this was a key moment for the early library but one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous events earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary's college from 1580 and as rector from 1590 melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to locky of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national lives throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in 2005 we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may 2021 and earlier this week we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the universities wardlaw museum our recently redeveloped museum situated on the scores which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and change makers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fife to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is 1 from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction the conferral of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia as that phrase indicates these rituals are conducted partly in latin following saint andrews tradition i will call upon the dean to present candidates for degrees from their faculty and i will then confer the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i raise you to the rank of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates cap or veratrum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete i shall then make a special presentation of the principles medal and award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to one of our graduates the principal's medal will today be bestowed upon salma ali of the school of biology since our theaters chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour doctor richard henderson to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor russell morris from the school of chemistry the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews you are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so while you are graduating you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life decanus facultatif ciencia vice chancellor i have the honour to present for the degree of bachelor of science

principles medal this award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by ede and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and robe makers in the world the award of the principal's medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year 2021 to 2022 the principal's medal is being awarded to two outstanding students today today we recognise salma ali who has just received the degree of master of biochemistry with honours and i'm pleased to note that she received a very strong first class degree salma's nomination references her formidable intellectual accomplishments she made the deans list for outstanding academic achievement in every year of study and she has just graduated with one of the most distinguished academic profiles of her entire class some was nominator rights that she can and i quote be ranked among the very best students ever to have taken a biological degree at the university of saint andrews salma's excellence in the classroom has been replicated in professional environments and her degree programme incorporated a one year external placement which she spent in the cell line development team at astrazeneca in cambridge last academic year a competitive option and one which resulted in an acclaimed undergraduate dissertation samba has undertaking undertaken other external non credit bearing research placements as an amgen scholar at the karolinska institute in stockholm sweden in 2019 as a research assistant in a neurogenetics lab at our university in the 2019 to 2020 academic year and for the past year as a researcher under the supervision of the head of the school of biology professor frank gumm moore it is the synergy of her remarkable theoretical comprehension with her fluency in professional environments that led to salma's nominator concluding and i quote again that salma is amongst the most gifted undergraduate students that i have ever encountered in over 30 years of teaching at UC berkeley the university of cambridge and the university of saint andrews such attainments are laudable in their own right but they dazzle when contextualised by the breadth of salma's other contributions to our university particularly her support for fostering diverse and inclusive academic environments in the 2019 to 2020 academic year some will participated in the global challenges programme as a researcher and strategist answering the question how can we make saint andrews a beacon of inclusivity not only did salma win the programme but she has since consolidated her fine her findings by cofounding and chairing the bane biology team within our school of biology in 2020 a network of students and researchers that organises activities designed to promote anti racist and inclusive cultures and which has been recognised as best practice and replicated in other schools some served also as a member of the school of biologies equality diversity and inclusion committee and in 2021 she joined the EDI advisory panel of the biochemical society an international learned society and on which panel she is the only student member salma models excellence while embodying a generous inclusive and passionate outlook that is an inspiration to her peers and tutors alike salma in recognition of your many accomplishments both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate it gives me very great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal's medal 3 party i call upon professor malcolm white of the school of biology vice chancellor it's my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of science on orders coza doctor richard henderson to understand the world around us we need to observe it in the 17th century anthony van levenhuk built his own light microscopes and he opened up a new world of biology in a drop of water in the 20th century structural biologists developed the use of X rays to visualize proteins and DNA in atomic detail revealing the secrets of the machinery of life and heralding a golden age of molecular biology today we honour richard henderson who pioneered the use of electrons to study biological structures an advance that's catalyzing another step change in our ability to see and to understand richard's childhood was spent in the scottish borders and he attended edinburgh university to read physics his interest turned towards the new discipline of molecular biology and he contributed to early advances in X ray crystallography during his PHD at the laboratory of molecular biology or LB in cambridge while working as a postdoctoral researcher at yale richard developed an interest in solving the structures of membrane proteins these were and still are very difficult to study with X rays and richard turned a turn to the alternative of using electrons which caused much less damage to biological samples returning to the LMPLB richard devoted to scientific career to the development of the technique of electron microscopy this must have required astonishing levels of perseverance as the crystallographers made great strides and electron microscopy was often viewed as a poor relation and starved of funding however perseverance is one of the key qualities scientists need and advances in sample preparation data collection and analysis over decades have communicated in the realisation of richard's vision over the past ten years electron microscopy has created another step change in our ability to see the world around us revolutionizing the field of molecular biology and in addition to its fundamental importance the ability to visualize these biological structures at atomic resolution opens the door to many new treatments for human disease amongst numerous awards richard shared the nobel prize in chemistry in 2017 characteristically when he got the call from stockholm he was in a research seminar and so he rejected it the call now the prize vice chancellor and recognition of his seminal contribution to the development of the field of electron microscopy i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of science on oris koza on doctor richard henderson tay at gradam torres ciencia honoris causa from review libelium superette hope vratham imponer congratulations so i'll just say a few words thanking st andrews for my award and perhaps on behalf of the others with one brief little story so my i first came to saint andrews in 1965 so that's sort of 57 years ago and i was an undergraduate at edinburgh university doing physics and like saint andrews we had lots of societies that undergraduates did extracurricular activities one of them was edinburgh university photographic society photo sock and one one day we brought a the results of the international exhibition from edinburgh fotostock to saint andrews fotostock and we did the exhibition and were welcomed by the equivalent people in saint andrews and treated us very well so that's my first memory i'm very fond memories of that time and so this is now another event to remember in terms of the associations with saint andrew so i'd like to just say thank you big thank you new vice chancellor and to malcolm for this degree and for welcome me and i have to say it's much less work than the effort that you people have put into getting your degree so thank you very very much i call upon bishop ward law professor russell morris of the school of chemistry butch chancellor on a guests graduates of saint andrews wow don't you look good what a sight for sure i'd i'd completely forgotten what it looked like to stand here and and see happy smiling faces at a graduation ceremony you look great this is a day to be proud first and foremost you should be proud of your own achievements it's been a tricky time to be a student let's face it the last couple of years and i i salute not only your academic skills but also your resilience i truly hope that whatever memories you take away from saint andrews it'll be of your friends and not the pandemic and it won't have spoiled anything about about your time here my colleagues and i we couldn't be prouder of all your achievements indeed i think there's only one set of people prouder than we are and that is all your supporters friends and family sitting here in the audience watching on the internet watching the DVD if it's still a DVD you may right you should spare a moment now to silently or loudly if you prefer thank them for their support over the years you now have one of the great degrees and i'll come back later on to exactly how great a saint andrews degree is but first a little bit of advice most of you here today are science may be some social science graduates and i will i will talk specifically about specifically about science but it translates equally well to all the degrees from saint andrews even to the pesky classics degrees which i'll come back to again later i'm a professor of chemistry right and in my office down down the road i'm lucky to have a bookcase that holds what's called the ervin collection the journals and textbooks that sir james irving left to the school of chemistry sir james was a was a was the professor of chemistry who actually ended up being the vice chancellor and principal for 30 plus years actually for a long time he was a fantastic scientist and leader who did so much for the university of saint andrews including having younger hall built where you are today and his name still still sits on the outside of the building it sounded like quite a cool guy actually i particularly enjoy the story of how as principal of the university he found the local colemans family playing cricket on the street he was not having any of that he took them back to the quad outside lower college hall where you'll be in a moment set up a pitch in wicket and bold the bold to them for the rest of the afternoon i think even in the 1930s it would have been a an unusual sight to see the principal coming in off the long run as they say i'll let you ask at the garden party whether our current principle is a demon bowler or not of all those books in the urban collection two of the slimmest volumes of my favourites these are transcripts of lectures that sir james gave during the time he was principal it's a truly fascinating to read his thoughts one delivered in 1940 was to celebrate the centenary of the professorship in chemistry at saint andrews our chair the first chair in chemistry was endowed through a request in 1808 just hold on a minute his lecture was given in 1940 sir james at first i wondered what just what it was too busy playing cricket to get around to giving the lecture but actually no he explained all with what i hope was a twinkle in his eye it turns out the classics department stole all the money and so there wasn't any left for a chemistry professor until until 1840 so he was right bang on 100 years as scientists we are magnanimous and gracious and of course we've forgiven the classicists but we don't let them know if we ever have any money the second volume is a series of three lectures given in canada in 1937 the subject of the lectures was science and citizenship it is very striking that so james's thoughts on the challenges of life in the 1930s and the need for science in society are similar in fact one might say scarily similar to today he clearly knew the role that science should play and how every scientist and every graduate needed to take responsibility for ensuring that the public we're engaged with the facts of any discussions it really could have been written for today we're all aware that there are great challenges in our world and that science will have a role to play and we'll play its part in solving them the challenges to illustrate sir james's view i'd just like to quote a short passage from the second lecture which was entitled science education and the fundamental values my contention is that the altruistic spirit can be fostered by scientific education so that a distinctive habit of mind is formed and the discipline of integrity and responsibility created which find their application in the wider life of the community in other words whatever you end up doing whether it's a pioneer and an academic field or an industrial field or an opera singer or you're taking ditches for the council doesn't actually matter your job now you have left the university of saint andrews those of you who are leaving some of you may be staying now that you're left with the saint andrews degree your job is to use your distinctive habit of mind for the benefit of society be an active participant in the important debates of the day we've all seen how the wonders of modern communication mean that good news and bad fake news and the truth travel quicker than ever in areas like the pandemic recovery or the climate crisis we desperately need a society that is science literate if we're to make the right choices it's your job that's a saint andrews graduate to help sort out the wheat from the chaff do not just believe the last person even if it's me you heard but use the skills you've learned here to evaluate the evidence come to the best possible conclusions and use your education to improve the world speaking of evaluating the evidence i i did promise to come back to the question of how good is a saint andrews degree now i'll use my own skills of evidence evaluation to to i think produce 2 incontrovertible facts about saint andrews degrees that show how good it really is how good they really are now in doing this you will have to remember that i don't have a degree from saint andrews the colours of this this gown are from an inferior university so i won't be as good as as you wouldn't be as good at it but i'll do my best fact number one the evidence nearly 20 years ago we gave an honorary degree to one highly eminent famous person he came happily sat on the on the stage where doctor henderson is now had a great day a few years later he was awarded the nobel prize for literature this time he pointedly refused to attend this ceremony couldn't be bothered so that's the evidence what conclusion can we come to well i think it's obvious getting the saint andrews degree must be better than winning a nobel prize i can't actually see doctor henderson i'm sure you know that right so that's incontrovertible fact number one what about fact number two OK you ready for this one this is even better what else is great about us and andrew's degree well fact #2 is that you've all got one congratulations have a great day fantastic thank you please stand for the benediction grazia dominique nostri yesu christi at caritas de

It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students are awarded their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these celebrations and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic, it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers. And loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall was closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Today's graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of this ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland senior Bishop, and consecrated. Upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict, the thirteen 13th, issued papal bills from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. The royal leaders of Scotland and later of the United Kingdom have been a guiding, enriching and at times challenging presence in our history. Saint Andrews was the spiritual home of Scotland and on occasion hosted the Scottish Court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the Royal household. Our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, served as an adviser and diplomat to King Rob at the 3rd and later as tutor and Protector to his son, the future King James, the first of Scotland, who resided with him in Saint Andrews Castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to France, which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in England for 18 years. King James Revisited St. Andrews throughout his life celebrating Christmas here in 1425 and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to Perth. His request was dutifully and happily ignored. Our university library, the oldest continuous library in Scotland, is indebted to royal patronage. King James, the 6th of Scotland and 1st of England visited St. Andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the University Library, a building in his honour. To accommodate this collection, the King James Library was completed in 1643 on South St. This was a key moment for the early library, but one suspects that King James. Was overcompensating for previous events earlier in his reign. King James clashed repeatedly with Andrew Melville, a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as Principal of Saint Mary's College from 1580 and as rector from 1590. Melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university, but was resistant to royal interference. Given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether, King James locked Melville in the Tower of London. Royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to Locky of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national lives throughout its existence. We enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating Her Majesty the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. We have been honoured by the presence of Her Majesty periodically throughout her reign, most recently at the graduation of our alumni, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in 2005. We were delighted to welcome their Royal Highnesses back to the university for a visit in May 2021 and earlier this week, we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge at the Universities Wardlaw Museum. Our recently redeveloped museum, situated on the scores, which is well worth a visit. In crossing today's stage, each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps, but also in the footsteps of the academics, leaders and change makers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of Fife to shape the world in profound ways. The journey you make from here is yours to envisage, but their example is 1, from which we can all draw inspiration. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to award degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. The conferral of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will confer degrees both on those many students who are present and on those who are unable to attend and who are thus graduated in absentia. As that phrase indicates, these rituals are conducted partly in Latin following Saint Andrews tradition. I will call upon the Dean to present candidates for degrees from their faculty, and I will then confer the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I raise you to the rank of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this, I place upon you this CAP. To most though, I will simply say at superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of graduation occurs when the graduates CAP or veratrum touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the ascension of our graduates into graduates and their assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, I shall then make a special presentation of the principles Medal and award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to one of our graduates. The Principal's medal will today be bestowed upon Salma Ali of the School of Biology. Since our theaters Chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Doctor Richard Henderson to close our ceremony. It is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our new graduates, wish them well as they progress to the next stage of their lives, and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Professor Russell Morris from the School of Chemistry. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. You are joining a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So while you are graduating, you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life. Decanus facultatif ciencia.

This award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by Ede and Ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and robe makers in the world. The award of the Principal's Medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at Saint Andrews. The awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline, and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular. For the academic year 2021 to 2022, the Principal's medal is being awarded to two outstanding students today. Today we recognise Salma Ali, who has just received the degree of Master of Biochemistry with honours, and I'm pleased to note that she received a very strong first class degree. Salma's nomination references her formidable intellectual accomplishments. She made the Deans list for outstanding academic achievement in every year of study, and she has just graduated with one of the most distinguished academic profiles of her entire class. Some was nominator rights that she can, and I quote, be ranked among the very best students ever to have taken a biological degree at the University of Saint Andrews. Salma's excellence in the classroom has been replicated in professional environments and her degree programme incorporated a one year external placement which she spent in the cell line development team at AstraZeneca in Cambridge last academic year. A competitive option and one which resulted in an acclaimed undergraduate dissertation. Samba has undertaking undertaken other external non credit bearing research placements as an Amgen scholar at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2019. As a research assistant in a neurogenetics lab at our university in the 2019 to 2020 academic year, and for the past year as a researcher under the supervision of the head of the School of Biology, professor Frank Gumm Moore. It is the synergy of her remarkable theoretical comprehension with her fluency in professional environments that led to salma's nominator. Concluding, and I quote again that Salma is amongst the most gifted undergraduate students that I have ever encountered in over 30 years of teaching at UC Berkeley. The University of Cambridge and the University of Saint Andrews. Such attainments are laudable in their own right, but they dazzle when contextualised by the breadth of salma's. Other contributions to our university, particularly her support for fostering diverse and inclusive academic environments. In the 2019 to 2020 academic year, some will participated in the global challenges programme as a researcher and strategist, answering the question, how can we make Saint Andrews a beacon of inclusivity? Not only did Salma win the programme, but she has since consolidated her fine. Her findings by cofounding and chairing the Bane biology team within our School of Biology in 2020. A network of students and researchers that organises activities designed to promote anti racist and inclusive cultures and which has been recognised as best practice and replicated in other schools. Some served also as a member of the School of Biologies, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Committee, and in 2021 she joined the EDI Advisory Panel of the Biochemical Society, an International learned society and on which panel she is the only student member. Salma models excellence while embodying a generous, inclusive and passionate outlook that is an inspiration to her peers and tutors alike. Salma, in recognition of your many accomplishments, both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate. It gives me very great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal's medal. 3. Party. I call upon Professor Malcolm White of the School of Biology. Vice Chancellor, it's my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Science on orders Coza doctor Richard Henderson. To understand the world around us, we need to observe it. In the 17th century, Anthony van Levenhuk built his own light microscopes and he opened up a new world of biology in a drop of water in the 20th century, structural biologists developed the use of X rays to visualize proteins and DNA in atomic detail. Revealing the secrets of the machinery of life and heralding a golden age of molecular biology. Today we honour Richard Henderson who pioneered the use of electrons to study biological structures. An advance that's catalyzing another step change in our ability to see and to understand. Richard's childhood was spent in the Scottish Borders, and he attended Edinburgh University to read physics. His interest turned towards the new discipline of molecular biology and he contributed to early advances in X ray crystallography during his PhD at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology or LB in Cambridge. While working as a postdoctoral researcher at Yale, Richard developed an interest in solving the structures of membrane proteins. These were, and still are very difficult to study with X rays, and Richard turned a turn to the alternative of using electrons, which caused much less damage to biological samples. Returning to the LMPLB, Richard devoted to scientific career to the development of the technique of electron microscopy. This must have required astonishing levels of perseverance, as the crystallographers made great strides, and electron microscopy was often viewed as a poor relation and starved of funding. However, perseverance is one of the key qualities scientists need and advances in sample preparation, data collection and analysis over decades have communicated in the realisation of Richard's vision. Over the past ten years, electron microscopy has created another step change in our ability to see the world around us, revolutionizing the field of molecular biology. And in addition to its fundamental importance, the ability to visualize these biological structures at atomic resolution opens the door to many new treatments for human disease. Amongst numerous awards, Richard shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2017, characteristically when he got the call from Stockholm. He was in a research seminar, and so he rejected it. The call, now the prize. Vice Chancellor and recognition of his seminal contribution to the development of the field of electron microscopy. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Science on Oris Koza on Doctor Richard Henderson. Tay at Gradam Torres Ciencia honoris causa. From review. Libelium superette hope vratham imponer. Congratulations. So I'll just say a few words. Thanking St. Andrews for my award and perhaps on behalf of the others, with one brief little story. So my I first came to Saint Andrews in 1965, so that's sort of 57 years ago. And I was an undergraduate at Edinburgh University doing physics and like Saint Andrews, we had lots of societies that undergraduates did extracurricular activities. One of them was Edinburgh University Photographic Society photo sock and one. One day we brought a the results of the International exhibition from Edinburgh Fotostock to Saint Andrews Fotostock and we did the exhibition and were welcomed by the equivalent people in Saint Andrews and treated us very well. So that's my first memory. I'm very fond memories of that time and so this is now another event to remember in terms of the associations with Saint Andrew. So I'd like to just say thank you. Big thank you. New Vice Chancellor and to Malcolm for this degree and for welcome me and I have to say it's much less work than the effort that you people have put into getting your degree. So thank you very very much. I call upon Bishop Ward law Professor Russell Morris of the School of Chemistry. Butch chancellor. On a guests. Graduates of Saint Andrews wow. Don't you look good? What a sight for sure, I'd I'd completely forgotten what it looked like to stand here and and see happy smiling faces at a graduation ceremony. You look great. This is a day to be proud. First and foremost, you should be proud of your own achievements. It's been a tricky time to be a student. Let's face it, the last couple of years and I I salute not only your academic skills but also your resilience. I truly hope that. Whatever memories you take away from Saint Andrews, it'll be of your friends and not the pandemic. And it won't have spoiled anything about about your time here. My colleagues and I. We couldn't be prouder of all your achievements. Indeed, I think there's only one set of people prouder than we are. And that is all your supporters. Friends and family sitting here in the audience watching on the Internet watching the DVD. If it's still a DVD, you may, right? You should spare a moment now to silently or loudly if you prefer. Thank them for their support over the years. You now have one of the great degrees. And I'll come back later on to exactly how great a Saint Andrews degree is. But first, a little bit of advice. Most of you here today are science. May be some social science graduates and I will. I will talk specifically about specifically about science, but it translates equally well to all the degrees from Saint Andrews even to the pesky classics degrees, which I'll come back to again later. I'm a professor of chemistry, right? And in my office, down down the road I'm lucky to have a bookcase that holds what's called the Ervin collection. The journals and textbooks that Sir James Irving left to the School of Chemistry. Sir James was a was a was the professor of chemistry who actually ended up being the vice chancellor and principal for 30 plus years. Actually, for a long time he was a fantastic scientist and leader who did so much for the University of Saint Andrews, including. Having younger Hall built where you are today and his name still still sits on the outside of the building. It sounded like quite a cool guy, actually. I particularly enjoy the story of how, as principal of the university, he found the local Colemans family playing cricket on the street. He was not having any of that. He took them back to the quad outside lower College Hall where you'll be in a moment, set up a pitch in wicket and bold the bold to them for the rest of the afternoon. I think even in the 1930s it would have been a an unusual sight to see the principal coming in off the long run. As they say, I'll let you ask at the Garden party whether our current principle is a demon bowler or not. Of all those books in the urban collection, two of the slimmest volumes of my favourites. These are transcripts of lectures that Sir James gave during the time he was principal. It's a truly fascinating to read his thoughts. One delivered in 1940, was to celebrate the centenary of the professorship in chemistry at Saint Andrews. Our chair, the first chair in chemistry, was endowed through a request. In 1808 just hold on a minute. His lecture was given in 1940. Sir James at first I wondered what just what it was too busy playing cricket to get around to giving the lecture but actually no. He explained all with what I hope was a twinkle in his eye. It turns out the Classics department stole all the money. And so there wasn't any left for a chemistry professor until until 1840, so he was right. Bang on 100 years. As scientists, we are magnanimous and gracious. And of course, we've forgiven the classicists. But we don't let them know if we ever have any money. The second volume. Is a series of three lectures given in Canada in 1937. The subject of the lectures was science and citizenship. It is very striking that so James's thoughts on the challenges of life in the 1930s and the need for science in society are similar. In fact, one might say scarily similar to today. He clearly knew the role that science should play, and how every scientist and every graduate needed to take responsibility for ensuring that the public we're engaged with the facts of any discussions. It really could have been written for today. We're all aware that there are great challenges in our world and that science will have a role to play. And we'll play its part in solving them. The challenges to illustrate Sir James's view. I'd just like to quote a short passage from the second lecture, which was entitled Science Education and the fundamental values. My contention is that the altruistic spirit can be fostered by scientific education so that a distinctive habit of mind is formed. And the discipline of integrity and responsibility created which find their application in the wider life of the community. In other words, whatever you end up doing, whether it's a pioneer and an academic field. Or an industrial field or an opera singer? Or you're taking ditches for the Council. Doesn't actually matter your job. Now you have left the University of Saint Andrews. Those of you who are leaving some of you may be staying. Now that you're left with the Saint Andrews degree, your job is to use your distinctive habit of mind for the benefit of society. Be an active participant in the important debates of the day. We've all seen how the wonders of modern communication mean that good news and bad fake news and the truth travel quicker than ever. In areas like the pandemic recovery or the climate crisis, we desperately need a society that is science literate. If we're to make the right choices. It's your job. That's a Saint Andrews graduate to help sort out the wheat from the chaff. Do not just believe the last person, even if it's me, you heard, but use the skills you've learned here to evaluate the evidence. Come. To the best possible conclusions and use your education to improve the world. Speaking of evaluating the evidence, I I did promise to come back to the question of how good. Is a Saint Andrews degree now. I'll use my own skills of evidence evaluation to to, I think, produce 2 incontrovertible facts about Saint Andrews degrees that show how good it really is, how good they really are. Now in doing this. You will have to remember that I don't have a degree from Saint Andrews. The colours of this this gown are from an inferior university. So I won't be as good as as you wouldn't be as good at it, but I'll do my best. Fact number one the evidence. Nearly 20 years ago, we gave an honorary degree to one highly eminent famous person. He came happily sat on the on the stage. Where Doctor Henderson is now. Had a great day. A few years later, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. This time he pointedly refused to attend. This ceremony couldn't be bothered. So that's the evidence. What conclusion can we come to? Well, I think it's obvious. Getting the Saint Andrews degree must be better than winning a Nobel Prize. I can't actually see Doctor Henderson. I'm sure you know that right? So that's incontrovertible. Fact number one. What about fact? Number two? OK, you ready for this one. This is even better. What else is great about us and Andrew's degree well? Fact #2 is that you've all got one, congratulations. Have a great day. Fantastic thank you. Please stand for the benediction.
