summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the young hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of this ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient the history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at fifteenth century saint andrews as to distracting but archery and important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows student life in saint leonards college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started class at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one 's weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like football should prove to distracting with the exception of a single lawn dress and on the condition that she was over fifty years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds saint andrews had become as described by one contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduced the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundreds student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest duplication of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred gathered guests garden parties were spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of a hundred and forty five universities and learned societies visited and one hundred honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of a building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors it is therefore sight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forbears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our theaters chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudi armours and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mckewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty one was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july twenty twenty one and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honourary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelor 's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say that's super tae meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we're thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour julian moore to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor linda goddard from the school of art history the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean

the UK and bringing performing arts to as wide an audience as possible i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of music on norris calza on jillian moore edgardo doctoris music eye honoris causa promoviendo kuyas ray in symbolum superette hope berekum imponer congratulations thank you vice chancellor thank you gary for your extremely generous words and thank you to all you graduates and families and friends for giving me such a warm welcome it's just a fantastic honour for me having lived chief heard all of my working life south of the border but having been born and grown up and educated in scotland and to be given this great honour by such by this distinguished and ancient university and a university out of which i know so many great ideas for the future are coming thanks to all of you and the most important thing i want to do today is to congratulate all of you graduates on this joyful occasion and occasion which i guess you could be forgiven for thinking and might never come you have unlike my generation you have done your degrees studied under the most extraordinary circumstances and challenges and you've worked behind screens for a lot of that time you've been denied for a lot of that time all the comradeship all the fun all the support and that we get from each other when we're studying but you've got here today and i reckon if you can do that you can do anything my admiration for you all is enormous thank you very much i call upon professor linda goddard at the school of art history vice chancellor 's honoured guests colleagues graduates of the university graduation ceremonies are a rare enough experience but this one especially so not only have you earned your degree an achievement worthy of celebration at the best of times but you have done so under extraordinarily difficult circumstances and you and your family and supporters have had to wait a whole year to finally mark the event in person it's so unusual you might even remember some of it this ceremony today cannot fully replace the loss of that celebration in the moment that we all hoped for a year ago but it does bring its own different advantages most importantly it gives you the right to party at least twice as hard to make up for lost time but distance also brings the chance for reflection and perspective a common feature of the graduation address is to recognise this moment as both the close of an intense and rewarding chapter and the beginning of a new unknown one with exciting possibilities those of you who are here today though are already one year into life beyond the bubble you've begun to gain some perspective on your saint andrews experience and perhaps to reflect on what your degree can do for you some of you may already be living up to the impressive achievements of former graduates that are frequently cited on such occasions but it is just as likely that many of you are still finding your way taking time to reflect trying out different pathways even just recovering and getting by and that is just fine in the year after i graduated from my first degree i was earning sixty pounds a week sorting dusty papers in a publishing house and that was the best of my jobs that year today i am honoured to be here among those congratulating you on your success it is also an opportunity to thank you for persevering while libraries closed internet connections sometimes failed and you were shut off from friends and family thanks go as well to your family friends and everyone who has supported you i know that i speak for my colleagues too when i say that it was the regular hour with students in the virtual seminar room that kept me going during lockdowns thank you too for often being the ones to remind us that other things were happening during the pandemic that others were and are suffering invasion violent oppression or the disproportionate effects of our collective neglect of the planet regardless of the varied paths that you take in life i urge you to keep speaking out saint andrews is a medieval pilgrimage site and you have made a pilgrimage to be here today perhaps you were drawn back by a final opportunity to walk on west sands not the best weather for it today unfortunately the chance to reunite with friends and perhaps teachers from different subjects is probably one of the reasons you made the journey back for another different and special thing about this ceremony is that it is not limited to a few subjects but involves all our schools and departments i wish for you a world where as in this room the arts and sciences talk to each other and the friendships formed here last a lifetime and now it is already a year late so let the celebrations begin congratulations please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas today at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism amen alright",

chancellor thank you gary for your extremely generous words and thank you to all you graduates and families and friends for giving me such a warm welcome it's just a fantastic honour for me having lived chief heard all of my working life south of the border but having been born and grown up and educated in scotland and to be given this great honour by such by this distinguished and ancient university and a university out of which i know so many great ideas for the future are coming thanks to all of you and the most important thing i want to do today is to congratulate all of you graduates on this joyful occasion and occasion which i guess you could be forgiven for thinking and might never come you have unlike my generation you have done your degrees studied under the most extraordinary circumstances and challenges and you've worked behind screens for a lot of that time you've been denied for a lot of that time all the comradeship all the fun all the support and that we get from each other when we're studying but you've got here today and i reckon if you can do that you can do anything my admiration for you all is enormous thank you very much i call upon professor linda goddard at the school of art history vice chancellor's honoured guests colleagues graduates of the university graduation ceremonies are a rare enough experience but this one especially so not only have you earned your degree an achievement worthy of celebration at the best of times but you have done so under extraordinarily difficult circumstances and you and your family and supporters have had to wait a whole year to finally mark the event in person it's so unusual you might even remember some of it this ceremony today cannot fully replace the loss of that celebration in the moment that we all hoped for a year ago but it does bring its own different advantages most importantly it gives you the right to party at least twice as hard to make up for lost time but distance also brings the chance for reflection and perspective a common feature of the graduation address is to recognise this moment as both the close of an intense and rewarding chapter and the beginning of a new unknown one with exciting possibilities those of you who are here today though are already one year into life beyond the bubble you've begun to gain some perspective on your saint andrews experience and perhaps to reflect on what your degree can do for you some of you may already be living up to the impressive achievements of former graduates that are frequently cited on such occasions but it is just as likely that many of you are still finding your way taking time to reflect trying out different pathways even just recovering and getting by and that is just fine in the year after i graduated from my first degree i was earning 60 pounds a week sorting dusty papers in a publishing house and that was the best of my jobs that year today i am honoured to be here among those congratulating you on your success it is also an opportunity to thank you for persevering while libraries closed internet connections sometimes failed and you were shut off from friends and family thanks go as well to your family friends and everyone who has supported you i know that i speak for my colleagues too when i say that it was the regular hour with students in the virtual seminar room that kept me going during lockdowns thank you too for often being the ones to remind us that other things were happening during the pandemic that others were and are suffering invasion violent oppression or the disproportionate effects of our collective neglect of the planet regardless of the varied paths that you take in life i urge you to keep speaking out saint andrews is a medieval pilgrimage site and you have made a pilgrimage to be here today perhaps you were drawn back by a final opportunity to walk on west sands not the best weather for it today unfortunately the chance to reunite with friends and perhaps teachers from different subjects is probably one of the reasons you made the journey back for another different and special thing about this ceremony is that it is not limited to a few subjects but involves all our schools and departments i wish for you a world where as in this room the arts and sciences talk to each other and the friendships formed here last a lifetime and now it is already a year late so let the celebrations begin congratulations please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas today at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus

It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly. And the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the young hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of this ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception. And our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient. The history but creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors, often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics. All inspired by Aristotle. Speaking in the vernacular was forbidden, and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in Latin, which remained our official institutional language until 1747. Examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by ones professors, and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century St. Andrews as to distracting, but archery and important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted. This may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470, when, after an unresolved argument, the Dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows. Student life in St. Leonards College. Over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university. Founded within a religious capital, students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six. Started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one's weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly forbidden, lest they, like football, should prove to distracting, with the exception of a single lawn dress. And on the condition that she was over 50 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Adam Ferguson, a renowned Enlightenment philosopher, graduated in 1742. James Wilson, a founding father of the United States, studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD. Or Doctor of medicine by the university. The French revolutionary Jean Paul Marat in 1775. And in 1792. Edward Jenner, whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox, pioneered modern immunology. By the beginning of the 1800s, Saint Andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. A healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by way of the University Scotland Act of 1858 introduced the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day, women were admitted to full-time study in 1892, and by the 1900s student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences. Perhaps the greatest duplication of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of September 1911, which resemble our activities today. Planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests. Garden parties were spread across the town. Speeches were delivered. Representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed. A student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the Bell Pettigrew Museum, and the town came to life with song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in June 1929. Its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of a building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors. It is therefore sight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better. As so many have done before them. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forbears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our theaters Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudi armours and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald Mckewen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in June or July 2021, and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred, with the exception of our honourary graduate, who will be recognised for the first time. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I will use to confirm the degrees, will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at Bachelor's Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties, and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirmed the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP to most, though I will simply say. That's super tae meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews Taylor, and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our veterans Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude, and we're thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Julian Moore. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Professor Linda Goddard from the School of Art History. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews, and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

Honoris causa Gillian Moore. Gillian Moore is director of music and performing arts at the South Bank Center. For those of you who have not had the pleasure of visiting the South Bank Centre, which sits on the River Thames in central London, it is the largest art centre in the UK and one of the largest cultural institutions in the world. It's made up of the Royal Festival Hall. The Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Purcell Room, the Hayward Gallery, the National Poetry Library and Arts Council collection. It hosts 4.4 million visitors a year. With 40% of its events being free. The South Bank Center is home to 8 resident and associate orchestras and Gillian Overseas. The programming of all music events, classical, jazz and contemporary. She is committed to finding new audiences and supporting new music. And is at the forefront of addressing questions about how to ensure diversity and quality across the UK's musical culture. The breadth and extent of the events at the South Bank is astonishing. Take this month of June, some 60 events including feminist pop icon Peaches. Andrea Schiff playing all five of Beethoven's piano concertos. A Grace Jones extravaganza. Wagner's Parsifal events. To celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee and an outdoor roller escape disco. To name just a few. Gillian was born in Glasgow, studied music there, and has worked throughout her career to bring music and the arts to the widest possible community. For 10 years she was the education officer at the London Sinfonietta and was instrumental in making it the first ensemble in the UK to launch a music education program. Later becoming its artistic director. At the South Bank Centre, she became head of Education, head of contemporary culture and then director of Music and Performing Arts. Gillian has a particular interest in 20th century music and has communicated eloquently about composers such as Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Igor Stravinsky and the subsequent minimalists. In her 2019 book on Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, the music of Modernity, it was published to critical acclaim. During her career, Gillian has collaborated with many of the Great Musical and artistic figures of our age, from Luciano Berio to Radiohead from Harrison Birtwistle to square pusher. From Steve Rich to Akram Khan and has commissioned many significant new works. She has received many awards for her contribution to British music and has served on the jury of the Leeds International Piano Competition. The international bezanson competition for Young Conductors and is a regular contributor to the BBC Proms Television coverage and BBC Radio 3. In the UK awards system, which rewards exceptional service, she was awarded an MBE in 1994 and a higher level CBE in 2019. Speaking on Radio 3 about album Bergs Lulu. Gillian said Berg used everything in his armoury to tell complex truths about women and men and love and life in a way that transforms human experience into something transcendent and that, for me, is what art is all about. This I feel, encapsulates Julian's passion for the transformational power of music and art to change people's lives. Vice chancellor in recognition of her major contribution to the cultural life of the UK and bringing performing arts to as wide an audience as possible. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Music on Norris Calza on Jillian Moore. Edgardo Doctoris music. Eye honoris causa promoviendo kuyas ray in Symbolum superette, hope berekum imponer. Congratulations. Thank you, vice chancellor. Thank you Gary, for your extremely generous words and thank you to all you graduates and families and friends for giving me such a warm welcome. It's just a fantastic honour for me having lived. Chief heard all of my working life South of the border, but having been born and grown up and educated in Scotland, and to be given this great honour by such by this distinguished and ancient university and a university out of which I know so many great ideas for the future, are coming thanks to all of you and the most important thing I want to do today is to congratulate. All of you graduates on this joyful occasion and occasion, which I guess you could be forgiven for thinking and might never come. You have, unlike my generation, you have done your degrees studied under the most extraordinary circumstances and challenges, and you've worked behind screens for a lot of that time. You've been denied for a lot of that time. All the comradeship, all the fun, all the support. And that we get from each other when we're studying. But you've got here today and I reckon if you can do that, you can do anything. My admiration for you all is enormous. Thank you very much. I call upon Professor Linda Goddard at the School of Art History. Vice Chancellor's honoured guests colleagues. Graduates of the university. Graduation ceremonies are a rare enough experience, but this one especially so. Not only have you earned your degree. An achievement worthy of celebration at the best of times. But you have done so under extraordinarily difficult circumstances. And you and your family and supporters have had to wait a whole year to finally mark the event in person. It's so unusual you might even remember some of it. This ceremony today cannot fully replace the loss of that celebration in the moment that we all hoped for a year ago. But it does bring its own different advantages. Most importantly, it gives you the right to party at least twice as hard to make up for lost time. But distance also brings the chance for reflection and perspective. A common feature of the graduation address is to recognise this moment as both the close of an intense and rewarding chapter. And the beginning of a new unknown one with exciting possibilities. Those of you who are here today, though, are already one year into life beyond the bubble. You've begun to gain some perspective on your Saint Andrews experience. And perhaps to reflect on what your degree can do for you. Some of you may already be living up to the impressive achievements of former graduates that are frequently cited on such occasions. But it is just as likely that many of you are still finding your way. Taking time to reflect. Trying out different pathways. Even just recovering and getting by. And that is just fine. In the year after I graduated from my first degree, I was earning 60 pounds a week, sorting dusty papers in a publishing house, and that was the best of my jobs that year. Today I am honoured to be here. Among those congratulating you on your success. It is also an opportunity to thank you. For persevering while libraries closed Internet connections sometimes failed and you were shut off from friends and family. Thanks go as well to your family, friends and everyone who has supported you. I know that I speak for my colleagues too when I say that it was the regular hour with students in the virtual seminar room that kept me going during lockdowns. Thank you too for often being the ones to remind us that other things were happening during the pandemic. That others were and are suffering invasion violent oppression, or the disproportionate effects of our collective neglect of the planet. Regardless of the varied paths that you take in life, I urge you to keep speaking out. Saint Andrews is a medieval pilgrimage site and you have made a pilgrimage to be here today. Perhaps you were drawn back by a final opportunity to walk on West Sands. Not the best weather for it today, unfortunately. The chance to reunite with friends and perhaps teachers from different subjects is probably one of the reasons you made the journey back. For another, different and special thing about this ceremony is that it is not limited to a few subjects, but involves all our schools and departments. I wish for you a world where, as in this room the Arts and Sciences talk to each other and the friendships formed here last a lifetime. And now it is already a year late, so let the celebrations begin. Congratulations. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi. At Caritas today at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism, Amen. Alright."
