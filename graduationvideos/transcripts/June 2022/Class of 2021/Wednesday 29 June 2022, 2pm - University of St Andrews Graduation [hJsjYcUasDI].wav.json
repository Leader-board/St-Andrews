good afternoon everybody it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of this ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors as it's not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient the history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of the curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by one one 's professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at fifteenth century saint andrews as two distracted but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows student life in saint leonards college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidenced more of the asceticism of a university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started class at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like football should prove to distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over fifty years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD 's or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds saint andrews had become as described by one contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundreds student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred gathered guests garden parties spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of a hundred and forty five universities and learned societies visited and one hundred honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the belle pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors it is their foresight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty one was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that pacity of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july twenty twenty one and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelor 's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete i shall then make a special presentation of the principles medal an award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to one of our graduates the principles medal for the academic year twenty twenty to twenty twenty one will today be bestowed upon two graduates tom conti leslie formerly of the school of mathematics and statistics and leo wyman who received a joint degree from the schools of international relations and geography and sustainable development since our veterans chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire in his hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is alistair merrill vice principal governance the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life dequina 's faculty artis arzum vice chancellor i ask you to confirm the degree of master of arts general on robert miller tail in gradu

was inaugurated thirteen years ago with a gift from three anonymous donors and is supported by eid and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of taylors and road makers in the world the award of the principal 's medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year twenty twenty to twenty twenty one the principles medal was awarded to three outstanding students and this celebration enables us to bestow the medal in the customary way today we recognise tom conti leslie and lea wyman and i'm pleased to note that both tom and leah received first class degrees in twenty twenty one i will now first present the principal 's medal to tom conti leslie tom has perhaps the finest student record i have seen during my time at saint andrews tom completed thirty two modules in his four years of study and he received a grade of nineteen or twenty in all but three of these and graduated with a GPA of nineteen point five tom made the deans list for each year of study received the alexander stuart prize for the best junior honours student in mathematics twice over attained the mathematics medal for performance at honours level and also the miller prize bestowed upon the most outstanding graduate student in the entire faculty of science with such a supreme record one could anticipate that tom spent every waking hour in the library instead tom committed over four hundred hours of service to supporting the well being and mental health of his fellow students through the student LED listening service nightline in january twenty twenty tom stepped forward from this anonymous volunteering to become director of the saint andrews nightline service for twelve months during which tenure he coordinated the response to the covid nineteen pandemic and transitioned all services online for the first time in their forty year history without losing a day of service this work was recognised with the john honey award for twenty twenty one bestowed by the proctor upon the student who has made the most outstanding contribution to student welfare tony 's capacities are seemingly limitless and in addition to nightline he served as president of the mathematics society senior student at john burnett hall and last but by no means least as band manager for the student ukulele group nuclear fusion tom's service to nightline continues and after graduating he transitioned to a full time position at nightline france based in paris through which he has supported student mental health while leading projects that consolidate nightlines research in france and across europe tom is however due to leave nightline next year to commence work as a software developer based in cambridge in line with his ambition to draw more regularly upon his technical skills and training tom in recognition of your superlative accomplishments both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal 's medal i will now present the principles medal to leo wyman leah is first and foremost an outstandingly accomplished scholar and she graduated with one of the most distinguished academic profiles in her entire cohort but layer tirelessly goes above and beyond to put her insightful theoretical understandings of politics and sustainability into practice through environmental activism which is as compelling as it is inventive inspiring and impactful environmental work for lair is not about assuming positions of responsibility instead it is a deeply felt mission and attitude that she integrates into every area of her life while seeking also to motivate others to become increasingly mindful of their relationship to the planet and its resources to that end lea runs an advocacy website eco activist which includes everything from vegan recipes to self produced podcasts and in twenty twenty leah launched her first book a collection of environmental poetry entitled dear earth layout puts passion into practice through her significant organising activities she took a leading role in organising climate protests in saint andrews including the line in the sand demonstration in twenty nineteen and in the twenty twenty to twenty twenty one academic year later served both as the environment officer at the students association and as an advisor to the universities environmental sustainability board the chair of that board professor sir ian boyd FRS the former chief scientific officer at the UK government 's department for the environment food and rural affairs and a member of the university school of biology wrote in the nomination that leah has the capacity to capture the imagination of other students and has achieved this through organisation political intelligence and hard work leila is currently reading for the degree of master of laws in global environment and climate change law at the university of edinburgh and it will come as no surprise that she underpins that with continuing public service layers still often supports saint andrews including through the return of the line in the sand demonstration ahead of COP twenty six last autumn but she works much more broadly as a greenpeace youth speaker in scottish primary schools at the scottish parliament where she presented recommendations on the scottish good food nation bill at the end of march and at the beginning of this month as a youth delegate to the united nations stockholm plus fifty conference marking fifty years since the publication of the stockholm declaration on the environment layer in recognition of all that you have achieved both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate it gives me very great pleasure to bestow upon you the principles medal it's so slow really my favorite time of day boy police say draw i long stay almost by dawn my niece go john sure my choice try right thank you i call upon the vice principle governance alistair merrill vice chancellor honoured guests colleagues and above all graduates of the university congratulations you have done it and you've actually done it twice an online graduation last year perhaps like in my household at a family barbecue in the garden although with today's weather i wouldn't necessarily recommend that as an attractive proposition and now finally here you are in person back in saint andrews and your smartest clothes in national dress in the newly refurbished younger hall it's a wonderful moment now traditionally a graduation address talks about the transition from being a student to being part of the family of alumni and offers some wise words of advice about your journey out of the bubble and into the world outside but this is not a traditional year you left the bubble twelve months ago you're already alumni you've begun jobs you've travelled you've commenced further studies you've started to explore and understand the next stage of life both the UPS and the downs your time at saint andrews has become woven into your past not yet perhaps viewed entirely through rose tinted glasses but the fact that you have returned here shows the saint andrews is also part of your present and your future and your cohort the class of twenty twenty one is not a traditional cohort the pandemic has had a huge impact on all of us but particularly on your generation the aftershocks of covid will last a long time and whilst we may no longer have to endure lockdowns the world will never be the same again as it was before january twenty twenty but that is not of itself a bad thing a hundred years ago society was also going through a period of tumultuous change emerging from the twin cataclysms of the great war and the pandemic known as the spanish flu and it was in that year that the then rector JM barry the author of peter pan delivered his rectorial address on the theme of courage to a generation of young people scarred by the experience of war and pandemic his speech championed the spirit and optimism of the young and celebrated the importance of the lifelong friendships and alliances that have forged during these precious years at university barry called for a partnership across the generations based on toleration kindness consideration for others a century on these values still resonate strongly with all of us who love this university and what it stands for in a fragmenting and unstable world barry talked of how these values coupled with the spirit of rigorous intellectual inquiry could create hope optimism and ambition for a better future and where better to inspire and shape that future today than here at the UK 's number one university barry told the students there are glorious years ahead of you if you choose to make them glorious so i say to you have the courage to shape your future to seize the opportunities that life presents but also have the courage always to hold true to your core values they will guide you through the tough times and make the good times even better barry pictured a former student being able to return for one single day in their later life to the saint andrews of their period would they he asked spend this time in lectures and earnest study well only about half of these few precious hours would be passed in such purely intellectual pursuits he reckoned the rest of the time as he put it they were far more likely to be cluttering up and down in search of old companions well you have returned you have found i hope some old companions this is the closest you'll come today to a lecture theatre and you are here to celebrate both the past and the future but before you go out of the hall to the sound of the pipes and begin your well deserved celebrations take a moment to look around you take a moment to cherish this unique coming together and to recognize that you've not made this journey alone but through the love the help the patience and the support of your family your friends your teachers and supporters some of them are with you today in person some in spirit take a moment to appreciate them to thank them in your heart and now go forth and celebrate what you have achieved and what you will achieve as barry said to the students of a hundred years ago there are glorious days ahead of you if you choose to make them glorious and there is a glorious and hopefully not too damp procession and garden party awaiting you now thank you please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism army",

university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at 5:00 AM attended mass at six started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like football should prove to distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over 50 years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in 1742 james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD's or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marat in 1775 and in 1792 edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s saint andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of 1858 introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in 1892 and by the 1900s student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september 1911 which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed a student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the belle pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june 1929 its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors it is their foresight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before them returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that pacity of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july 2021 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelor's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete i shall then make a special presentation of the principles medal an award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to one of our graduates the principles medal for the academic year 2020 to 2021 will today be bestowed upon 2 graduates tom conti leslie formerly of the school of mathematics and statistics and leo wyman who received a joint degree from the schools of international relations and geography and sustainable development since our veterans chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire in his hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is alistair merrill vice principal governance the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life dequina's

graduates i should now like to introduce the principles medal this award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by eid and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of taylors and rd makers in the world the award of the principal's medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year 2020 to 2021 the principles medal was awarded to three outstanding students and this celebration enables us to bestow the medal in the customary way today we recognise tom conti leslie and lea wyman and i'm pleased to note that both tom and leah received first class degrees in 2021 i will now first present the principal's medal to tom conti leslie tom has perhaps the finest student record i have seen during my time at saint andrews tom completed 32 modules in his four years of study and he received a grade of 19 or 20 in all but three of these and graduated with a GPA of 19.5 tom made the deans list for each year of study received the alexander stuart prize for the best junior honours student in mathematics twice over attained the mathematics medal for performance at honours level and also the miller prize bestowed upon the most outstanding graduate student in the entire faculty of science with such a supreme record one could anticipate that tom spent every waking hour in the library instead tom committed over 400 hours of service to supporting the well being and mental health of his fellow students through the student LED listening service nightline in january 2020 tom stepped forward from this anonymous volunteering to become director of the saint andrews nightline service for 12 months during which tenure he coordinated the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and transitioned all services online for the first time in their 40 year history without losing a day of service this work was recognised with the john honey award for 2021 bestowed by the proctor upon the student who has made the most outstanding contribution to student welfare tony's capacities are seemingly limitless and in addition to nightline he served as president of the mathematics society senior student at john burnett hall and last but by no means least as band manager for the student ukulele group nuclear fusion tom's service to nightline continues and after graduating he transitioned to a full time position at nightline france based in paris through which he has supported student mental health while leading projects that consolidate nightlines research in france and across europe tom is however due to leave nightline next year to commence work as a software developer based in cambridge in line with his ambition to draw more regularly upon his technical skills and training tom in recognition of your superlative accomplishments both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal's medal i will now present the principles medal to leo wyman leah is first and foremost an outstandingly accomplished scholar and she graduated with one of the most distinguished academic profiles in her entire cohort but layer tirelessly goes above and beyond to put her insightful theoretical understandings of politics and sustainability into practice through environmental activism which is as compelling as it is inventive inspiring and impactful environmental work for lair is not about assuming positions of responsibility instead it is a deeply felt mission and attitude that she integrates into every area of her life while seeking also to motivate others to become increasingly mindful of their relationship to the planet and its resources to that end lea runs an advocacy website eco activist which includes everything from vegan recipes to self produced podcasts and in 2020 leah launched her first book a collection of environmental poetry entitled dear earth layout puts passion into practice through her significant organising activities she took a leading role in organising climate protests in saint andrews including the line in the sand demonstration in 2019 and in the 2020 to 2021 academic year later served both as the environment officer at the students association and as an advisor to the universities environmental sustainability board the chair of that board professor sir ian boyd FRS the former chief scientific officer at the UK government's department for the environment food and rural affairs and a member of the university school of biology wrote in the nomination that leah has the capacity to capture the imagination of other students and has achieved this through organisation political intelligence and hard work leila is currently reading for the degree of master of laws in global environment and climate change law at the university of edinburgh and it will come as no surprise that she underpins that with continuing public service layers still often supports st andrews including through the return of the line in the sand demonstration ahead of COP 26 last autumn but she works much more broadly as a greenpeace youth speaker in scottish primary schools at the scottish parliament where she presented recommendations on the scottish good food nation bill at the end of march and at the beginning of this month as a youth delegate to the united nations stockholm plus 50 conference marking 50 years since the publication of the stockholm declaration on the environment layer in recognition of all that you have achieved both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate it gives me very great pleasure to bestow upon you the principles medal it's so slow really my favorite time of day boy police say draw i long stay almost by dawn my niece go john sure my choice try right thank you i call upon the vice principle governance alistair merrill vice chancellor honoured guests colleagues and above all graduates of the university congratulations you have done it and you've actually done it twice an online graduation last year perhaps like in my household at a family barbecue in the garden although with today's weather i wouldn't necessarily recommend that as an attractive proposition and now finally here you are in person back in saint andrews and your smartest clothes in national dress in the newly refurbished younger hall it's a wonderful moment now traditionally a graduation address talks about the transition from being a student to being part of the family of alumni and offers some wise words of advice about your journey out of the bubble and into the world outside but this is not a traditional year you left the bubble 12 months ago you're already alumni you've begun jobs you've travelled you've commenced further studies you've started to explore and understand the next stage of life both the UPS and the downs your time at saint andrews has become woven into your past not yet perhaps viewed entirely through rose tinted glasses but the fact that you have returned here shows the saint andrews is also part of your present and your future and your cohort the class of 2021 is not a traditional cohort the pandemic has had a huge impact on all of us but particularly on your generation the aftershocks of covid will last a long time and whilst we may no longer have to endure lockdowns the world will never be the same again as it was before january 2020 but that is not of itself a bad thing 100 years ago society was also going through a period of tumultuous change emerging from the twin cataclysms of the great war and the pandemic known as the spanish flu and it was in that year that the then rector JM barry the author of peter pan delivered his rectorial address on the theme of courage to a generation of young people scarred by the experience of war and pandemic his speech championed the spirit and optimism of the young and celebrated the importance of the lifelong friendships and alliances that have forged during these precious years at university barry called for a partnership across the generations based on toleration kindness consideration for others a century on these values still resonate strongly with all of us who love this university and what it stands for in a fragmenting and unstable world barry talked of how these values coupled with the spirit of rigorous intellectual inquiry could create hope optimism and ambition for a better future and where better to inspire and shape that future today than here at the UK's number one university barry told the students there are glorious years ahead of you if you choose to make them glorious so i say to you have the courage to shape your future to seize the opportunities that life presents but also have the courage always to hold true to your core values they will guide you through the tough times and make the good times even better barry pictured a former student being able to return for one single day in their later life to the saint andrews of their period would they he asked spend this time in lectures and earnest study well only about half of these few precious hours would be passed in such purely intellectual pursuits he reckoned the rest of the time as he put it they were far more likely to be cluttering up and down in search of old companions well you have returned you have found i hope some old companions this is the closest you'll come today to a lecture theatre and you are here to celebrate both the past and the future but before you go out of the hall to the sound of the pipes and begin your well deserved celebrations take a moment to look around you take a moment to cherish this unique coming together and to recognize that you've not made this journey alone but through the love the help the patience and the support of your family your friends your teachers and supporters some of them are with you today in person some in spirit take a moment to appreciate them to thank them in your heart and now go forth and celebrate what you have achieved and what you will achieve as barry said to the students of 100 years ago there are glorious days ahead of you if you choose to make them glorious and there is a glorious and hopefully not too damp procession and garden party awaiting you now thank you please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism army",

Good afternoon everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929, the younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of this ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. As it's not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient. The history but creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors, often in the teachers private residence as part of the curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics. All inspired by Aristotle speaking in the vernacular, was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in Latin which remained our official institutional language until 1747. Examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by one one's professors, and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century St. Andrews as two distracted but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm, was promoted. This may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470, when after an unresolved argument the Dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with bows and arrows. Student life in St. Leonards College. Over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of a university founded within a religious capital. Students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six. Started class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continue to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one. Weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly forbidden, lest they, like football, should prove to distracting, with the exception of a single laundress. And on the condition that she was over 50 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Adam Ferguson, a renowned Enlightenment philosopher, graduated in 1742. James Wilson, a founding father of the United States, studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of. MD's or Doctor of Medicine by the university the French revolutionary Jean Paul Marat in 1775 and in 1792 Edward Jenner, whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox, pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s, Saint Andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. A healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by way of the University Scotland Act of 1858 introduce the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day. Women were admitted to full-time study in 1892 and by the 1900s student life resembled many of our current graduates experiences. Perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of September 1911, which resemble our activities today. Planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties spread across the town. Speeches were delivered representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed. A student ball took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the Belle Pettigrew Museum, and the town came to life with song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in June 1929. Its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honour of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors. It is their foresight to which the splendour of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better. As so many have done. Before them. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that pacity of quintessential festivities. One year later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in June or July 2021. And thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I will use to confirm the degrees, will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at Bachelor's Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties, and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirm the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP. To most though, I will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, I shall then make a special presentation of the principles medal an award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to one of our graduates. The Principles medal for the academic year 2020 to 2021 will today be bestowed upon 2 graduates. Tom Conti, Leslie, formerly of the School of Mathematics and Statistics, and Leo Wyman, who received a joint degree from the schools of International Relations and Geography. And sustainable development. Since our veterans Chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director Claire in his Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Alistair Merrill, vice principal governance. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments.

I should now like to introduce the principles medal. This award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by Eid and Ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of Taylors and Rd makers in the world. The award of the Principal's Medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at Saint Andrews. The awards are open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular. For the academic year 2020 to 2021, the Principles Medal was awarded to three outstanding students, and this celebration enables us to bestow the medal in the customary way. Today we recognise Tom, Conti, Leslie and Lea Wyman, and I'm pleased to note that both Tom and Leah received first class degrees in 2021. I will now first present the principal's medal to Tom Conti Leslie. Tom has perhaps the finest student record I have seen during my time at Saint Andrews. Tom completed 32 modules in his four years of study and he received a grade of 19 or 20 in all but three of these and graduated with a GPA of 19.5. Tom made the Deans list for each year of study received. The Alexander Stuart Prize for the best Junior Honours student in mathematics. Twice over attained the mathematics medal for performance at honours level and also the Miller Prize bestowed upon the most outstanding graduate student in the entire faculty of Science. With such a supreme record, one could anticipate that Tom spent every waking hour in the library. Instead, Tom committed over 400 hours of service to supporting the well being and mental health of his fellow students through the student LED listening service, Nightline in January 2020, Tom stepped forward from this anonymous volunteering to become director of the Saint Andrews Nightline service for 12 months, during which tenure he coordinated. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic and transitioned all services online for the first time in their 40 year history without losing a day of service. This work was recognised with the John Honey Award for 2021 bestowed by the Proctor upon the student, who has made the most outstanding contribution to student welfare. Tony's capacities are seemingly limitless, and in addition to Nightline, he served as president of the Mathematics Society senior student at John Burnett Hall and last, but by no means least, as band manager for the student Ukulele group Nuclear Fusion. Tom's service to Nightline continues and after graduating, he transitioned to a full time position at Nightline, France based in Paris, through which he has supported student mental health while leading projects that consolidate nightlines research in France and across Europe. Tom is, however, due to leave Nightline next year to commence work as a software developer based in Cambridge. In line with his ambition to draw more regularly upon his technical skills. And training. Tom, in recognition of your superlative accomplishments, both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate. It gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principal's medal. I will now present the principles medal to Leo Wyman. Leah is first and foremost an outstandingly accomplished scholar, and she graduated with one of the most distinguished academic profiles in her entire cohort. But layer tirelessly goes above and beyond to put her insightful theoretical understandings of politics and sustainability into practice through environmental activism, which is as compelling as it is inventive, inspiring and impactful. Environmental work for lair is not about assuming positions of responsibility. Instead, it is a deeply felt mission and attitude that she integrates into every area of her life while seeking also to motivate others to become increasingly mindful of their relationship to the planet and its resources. To that end, Lea runs an advocacy website, eco activist, which includes everything from vegan recipes to self produced podcasts. And in 2020, Leah launched her first book, a collection of environmental poetry entitled Dear Earth. Layout puts passion into practice through her significant organising activities, she took a leading role in organising climate protests in Saint Andrews, including the line in the sand demonstration in 2019 and in the 2020 to 2021 academic year later served both as the Environment officer at the Students Association and as an advisor to the Universities Environmental Sustainability Board. The chair of that board professor Sir Ian Boyd, FRS, the former chief scientific officer at the UK government's department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and a member of the University School of Biology, wrote in the nomination that Leah has the capacity to capture the imagination of other students and has achieved this through organisation, political intelligence and hard work. Leila is currently reading for the degree of Master of Laws in Global Environment and Climate Change Law at the University of Edinburgh, and it will come as no surprise that she underpins that with continuing public service layers still often supports St. Andrews, including through the return of the line in the sand demonstration ahead of COP 26 last autumn, but she works much more broadly as a Greenpeace youth speaker in Scottish primary schools at the Scottish Parliament, where she presented recommendations on the Scottish. Good Food Nation bill at the end of March and at the beginning of this month as a youth delegate to the United Nations, Stockholm Plus 50 conference marking 50 years since the publication of the Stockholm Declaration on the Environment Layer. In recognition of all that you have achieved both academically and personally during your time as an undergraduate, it gives me very great pleasure to bestow upon you the principles medal. It's so slow. Really. My favorite time of day. Boy police say. Draw. I. Long stay. Almost. By dawn my niece. Go. John. Sure. My choice. Try. Right? Thank you. I call upon the vice principle governance. Alistair Merrill. Vice Chancellor honoured guests, colleagues and above all, graduates of the university. Congratulations, you have done it. And you've actually done it twice. An online graduation last year, perhaps like in my household at a family barbecue in the garden. Although with today's weather I wouldn't necessarily recommend that as an attractive proposition. And now finally here you are in person back in Saint Andrews and your smartest clothes in national dress in the newly refurbished younger hall. It's a wonderful moment. Now, traditionally a graduation address talks about the transition from being a student to being part of the family of alumni and offers some wise words of advice about your journey out of the bubble and into the world outside. But this is not a traditional year. You left the bubble 12 months ago. You're already alumni. You've begun jobs. You've travelled. You've commenced further studies. You've started to explore and understand the next stage of life. Both the UPS and the Downs. Your time at Saint Andrews has become woven into your past, not yet, perhaps, viewed entirely through rose tinted glasses. But the fact that you have returned here. Shows the Saint Andrews is also part of your present. And your future. And your cohort. The class of 2021 is not a traditional cohort. The pandemic has had a huge impact on all of us, but particularly on your generation. The aftershocks of COVID will last a long time, and whilst we may no longer have to endure lockdowns the world will never be the same again as it was before January 2020. But that is not of itself a bad thing. 100 years ago society was also going through a period of tumultuous change. Emerging from the twin cataclysms of the Great War and the pandemic known as the Spanish Flu, and it was in that year that the then rector JM Barry, the author of Peter Pan, delivered his Rectorial address on the theme of courage. To a generation of young people, scarred by the experience of war and pandemic, his speech championed the spirit and optimism of the young and celebrated the importance of the lifelong friendships and alliances that have forged during these precious years at university. Barry called for a partnership across the generations based on toleration, kindness, consideration for others. A century on these values still resonate strongly with all of us who love this university and what it stands for. In a fragmenting and unstable World, Barry talked of how these values, coupled with the spirit of rigorous intellectual inquiry, could create hope, optimism, and ambition for a better future. And where better to inspire and shape that future today than here at the UK's number one university. Barry told the students there are glorious years ahead of you if you choose to make them glorious. So I say to you, have the courage to shape your future to seize the opportunities that life presents, but also have the courage always to hold true to your core values. They will guide you through the tough times and make the good times even better. Barry pictured a former student being able to return for one single day in their later life to the Saint Andrews. Of their period, would they? He asked, spend this time in lectures and earnest study. Well, only about half of these few precious hours would be passed in such purely intellectual pursuits. He reckoned the rest of the time as he put it, they were far more likely to be cluttering up and down in search of old companions. Well, you have returned. You have found. I hope some old companions. This is the closest you'll come today to a lecture theatre and you are here to celebrate both the past and the future. But before you go out of the hall to the sound of the pipes and begin your well deserved celebrations, take a moment to look around you. Take a moment to cherish this unique coming together and to recognize that you've not made this journey alone. But through the love, the help, the patience, and the support of your family, your friends, your teachers and supporters. Some of them are with you today in person, some in spirit. Take a moment to appreciate them to thank them in your heart. And now go forth and celebrate what you have achieved and what you will achieve. As Barry said to the students of 100 years ago. There are glorious days ahead of you if you choose to make them glorious, and there is a glorious and hopefully not too damp procession and garden party awaiting you now. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Grazia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi, at Caritas de, at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism. Army."
