university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proven resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the universities foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from penny scholar in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of fifteenth century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history scotty chronicle which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination the legend has it that saint louis was born in circa three hundred AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited johnny evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew 's far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint louis brought the relics which constituted one two one kneecap one humorous and saint andrews right hand to what bauer describes as the islands situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation 's patron saint the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued saint andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its six hundred years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the fifteenth century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in fourteen seventy nine and fourteen ninety four respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas 's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar 's poetry was amongst the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in fifteen oh eight and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin and neared into scots completing this in fifteen thirteen these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of saint leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan wills amongst many occupations are tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the sixth of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in fifteen sixty five later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin poetry delici portalarium scoutorama was sponsored by a graduate and early philanthropist of our university john scott in sixteen thirty seven and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from seventeen sixty five to seventeen sixty eight and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by willa muir an early female graduate of our university in nineteen ten who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that the mules perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today hosts some of the world 's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalises upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i'm invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty one was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july twenty twenty one and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the dean 's intern to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at super tay 's meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour kenny anderson to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is the assistant vice principal dean of learning and teaching professor frank lorenz mueller the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artis artsiom vice chancellor i ask you

that's left god i call upon the university chaplain reverend doctor donald mcewen vice chancellor it is my privilege to present for the degree of doctor of music on oras kausa kenny anderson kenny anderson or king creosote the name under which he performs is a singer and songwriter born in saint andrews a recording artist who has released over forty albums and a tireless supporter and promoter of music the last time i saw king creosote on this very stage was at a festival called the eye of the dog in twenty twelve when he played alongside fellow saint andrew and katie tunstall i doubt that he or anyone else that day expected he would return here on an occasion like this in the town he has always loved and which has inspired so much of his music kenny was brought up in a musical household his father billy anderson is an accordionist bandleader and teacher and his brothers ian and gordon have also had musical careers kenny attended the local secondary school madras college and then studied electronics and electrical engineering at edinburgh university but his heart was in music and on graduating he busked his way across europe forming the skiffle group the scooby doo orchestra when that ended as did a later band called the khartoum heroes great names aren't they kenny became a solo artist performing and recording songs from nineteen ninety eight on acoustic guitar and accordion often at home drawing on folk and electronica with tape loops and samples making something uniquely his own can creosote songs touch on the realities of ordinary lives relationships gone awry false starts and wrong turnings struggles in mind and moments of exaltation often laced with humour they revel in word play and are always sung with conviction in kenny 's beautiful revealing emotional vocals as the albums poured forth three or four a year initially released on his own fence label so the fence collective grew a gang of bands and artists drawn to kenny 's love for the underdog about as far from corporate polish as can be imagined a friends gig or festival would usually be in a village hall in fife often in anstruther with five or six bands on the bill musicians joining in with the others set kenny on the sound fisher and donaldson fudge donut sustaining the audience king creosote 's reputation grew beyond the east neuk of fife he briefly flirted with commercial success with the album bombshell and in twenty eleven he was nominated for the mercury music prize for his collaboration with john hopkins diamond mine kenny has said that he writes songs with the nostalgia built in and so he was the perfect choice to write the evocative music for from scotland with love a beautiful and moving documentary released in documentary film released in twenty fourteen featuring archive film of scots at work in dance halls playing as children on the streets on holiday at the seaside or leaving for a new life still writing performing and recording king creosote continues to give pleasure to audiences in fife and far beyond in songs rooted in the lives of people we would usually call unsung vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to music and culture in scotland i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of music on orders kausa on kenny anderson it's great movement more applause in a minute tea edgardo doctoris music eye honoris causa from movie curious ray in symbolum superette hope britam imponent hey who well thank you donald that has to be one of the greatest lorion addresses of all time thank you i'd also like to thank the senatus academic plus who have somehow agreed to confer this doctorate on yours truly and in particular the anonymous barty crouch whoever he or she is who stuck my name into the goblet of fire i thought bartley crouch was one of the good guys but my daughter louis tells me otherwise so apologies if i've upset that i could do i'd also like to thank my mum and dad one of my earliest memories one of my earliest magical memories is of my dad dragging an accordion off into the sunset amidst like a flurry of slamming doors and exhaust fumes and tyres squealing and then head return many hours after my bedtime with this cohort of troubadours that were all singing and smoking and drinking and swearing and i would sit at the top of the stairs thinking this has to be the life for me and then my mum would have to send me back to bed and then with a nocturnal dad some of you may have nocturnal dad but then my mum had to do the day job so she got us to school got me off to the boys brigade even yesterday found me a white bow tie that's my mom and but neither of them put any pressure on me to do well at school and as a thrown individual i chose to do quite well at school i had a very good short term memory and i loved what was happening outside the window so in nineteen eighty five i left edinburgh university with a degree much like you guys today and decided that it was time for me to drag my own accordion off in the sunset and i've been doing that for thirty three years mine and boy so regards some advice for y'all i'm gonna say good luck you've all proved that you can use your brains you've proved that to yourselves to your mum and dad to the senators academic with but maybe as you go forward in your lives maybe listen to your hearts and because that's where the magic lies it's in the heart so yeah thank you so so much and good luck we all get there in the end thank you i call upon the assistant vice principal dean of of learning and teaching professor frank lawrence mueller nowhere near as charming i'm afraid vice chancellor 's colleagues honoured guests and above all dear freshly confirmed graduates of the university of saint andrews graduation addresses usually begin with congratulations to those who have just received their degrees today however i want to start with a heartfelt expression of gratitude to our former students to their families and friends on behalf of everyone who works for this fine university i'd like to thank you all for making the effort to return here to celebrate your years at saint andrews with us we are not kidding ourselves about how easy it is to get here there is effectively one road into saint andrews and that one road routinely clogs clogs up at guardbridge the rail network gave up on us in nineteen sixty nine and as for docking your cruise ship down in the harbour forget it so we do not get a lot of passing trade if you are in saint andrews that's because you wanted to come here and you were not put off by the journey that makes the compliment you're paying the university by being here today very special your happiness you're just pride in your achievements your conspicuous talents your ability to cross the stage without causing structural damage to this refurbished hall and your impeccable death sense all of this adds lustre to the occasion and reminds all of us on this side of the stage and the many helpers behind the scenes what our work is really about it is about supporting generation after generation of remarkable young individuals to grow in confidence maturity knowledge skillfulness and scholarly acumen it is our sincere wish that we can make this process as happy and fulfilling as possible for our students we also hope that in the course of their time and sandrews they will succeed in becoming active parts of a community whose members support and learn from each other your role in today's ceremony amounts to more though than just a welcome indication that your time in saint andrews has left you connected to the university to the town to each other it also forms a part of an ongoing building process more than a century ago the great french thinker emil durkheim the father of the academic discipline of sociology pointed out how important rituals were for giving cohesion to social groups he observed that rituals generate a shared ecstasy that was needed to affirm collectively held beliefs now i guess this is all a bit tame for ecstasy but this does not take away from the fact that though we are here to affirm joyously if not yet ecstatically some of our most important shared beliefs we still need to spell them out that learning and academic achievement should be celebrated at such moments of celebration should be shared with those to whom we are indebted for their love support and trust our families and friends and that we acknowledge and respect the work and learning of those who have come before us and hope to pass on to the current and to future generations a world in which untrammeled learning for the benefit of all will be possible and will continue to be cherished the splendid ritual serves to make these messages more enchanting and unforgettable but if it does not serve two tires all more into a community by inviting us to reflect on and affirm the beliefs that are important to us then this wonderful event would be somewhat less special in this summer of twenty twenty two we have more reason than ever to reflect on the value of community and on how we express our communal living for two years the covid pandemic put a stop to events like this it made us fearful of each other 's breath and touch it banished us into our individual rooms and chained us to our laptops singers fell silent people stared nervously at carbon dioxide monitors and the greeting hello was largely replaced with a weary you're on mute we soon realized that this lack of direct human contact dulled our lives across the university we noticed that many students struggled with the sudden isolation with being cut off from their friendship groups and with having to study or by themselves students had to forego those old important community of community affirming rituals not just old favourites like snoozing together through an early morning lecture or packing into cafes at lunchtime but also practising presentations in front of each other or meeting up in person for revision or support groups let me add that it was not just students who suffered these privations but the whole university community we've all gone through tough times we've worried about sick loved ones that we were not allowed to visit or about our bored kids resenting the home schooling we inflicted on them and let us not forget that many families that belong to this university community were touched by serious illness and even loss it is not meant to belittle this pain when i say that there is some consolation to be drawn from looking back over these two years of covid misery from the glittering vantage point of this ceremony first we should note with some pride that we have come through this together all of us remain committed to our scholarly mission even when facing adversity the university tried its hardest to offer you the best teaching available and you generously repaid our efforts and rewarded yourselves with the greater achievement we are here to celebrate today you gained your degrees academic degrees from one of the finest universities in the world fair and square you demonstrated flexibility and genuity forbearance and tenacity you did yourselves proud but also your teachers and those here in this hall whose support and care have enabled you to grow into a successful resilient individuals for this i offer you and them my whole heart of congratulations when contemplating our journey through the covid years we can draw some more solace from a famous dictum by the austrian british philosopher karl popper who declared that all life is problem solving following this line of thought the difficulties and challenges we had to confront and overcome did not really diminish our lives rather they presented us with an opportunity to respond to its call even more intensively it is important though not to lose sight of two realizations that absolutely belong here first that we must be sensitive when appreciating others problems and be ready to admire how everyone seeks to resolve them in their own fashion and secondly that we need to be able to offer and accept kindness and help to and from others in our problem solving lives we did well because we live in and draw strength from communities formed by many different helpful connections i'm sure that's equipped and prepared you will live well and solve many more problems to be honest looking at the world right now we urgently need some great problem solvers and you are the extraordinary individuals who will step up to the challenge no pressure but we're counting on you for that graduates of twenty twenty one on behalf of the university of saint andrews i once again offer you our gratitude our heartfelt congratulations and every good wish for your future thanks please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti said kumon nebus nobis in secular secularism amen",

were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proven resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the universities foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the 12th century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in 1318 university instruction commenced here in may 1410 when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from penny scholar in august 1413 which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history scotty chronicle which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination the legend has it that saint louis was born in circa 300 AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited johnny evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew's far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint louis brought the relics which constituted 121 kneecap 1 humorous and saint andrews right hand to what bauer describes as the islands situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation's patron st the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued st andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its 600 years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in 1479 and 1494 respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas's use of scots was foundational for much literature that followed dunbar's poetry was amongst the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller in 1508 and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin and neared into scots completing this in 1513 these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of st leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan wills amongst many occupations are tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the 6th of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in 1565 later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin poetry delici portalarium scoutorama was sponsored by a graduate and early philanthropist of our university john scott in 1637 and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived degree less to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from 17 65 to 1768 and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by willa muir an early female graduate of our university in 1910 who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as herman brooke and franz kafka the literary culture that the mules perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today hosts some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalises upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i'm invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july 2021 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the dean's intern to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at super tay's meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour kenny anderson to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is the assistant vice principal dean of learning and teaching professor frank lorenz mueller the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a st andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artis artsiom vice chancellor i ask you to confirm the

and songwriter born in saint andrews a recording artist who has released over 40 albums and a tireless supporter and promoter of music the last time i saw king creosote on this very stage was at a festival called the eye of the dog in 2012 when he played alongside fellow st andrew and katie tunstall i doubt that he or anyone else that day expected he would return here on an occasion like this in the town he has always loved and which has inspired so much of his music kenny was brought up in a musical household his father billy anderson is an accordionist bandleader and teacher and his brothers ian and gordon have also had musical careers kenny attended the local secondary school madras college and then studied electronics and electrical engineering at edinburgh university but his heart was in music and on graduating he busked his way across europe forming the skiffle group the scooby doo orchestra when that ended as did a later band called the khartoum heroes great names aren't they kenny became a solo artist performing and recording songs from 1998 on acoustic guitar and accordion often at home drawing on folk and electronica with tape loops and samples making something uniquely his own can creosote songs touch on the realities of ordinary lives relationships gone awry false starts and wrong turnings struggles in mind and moments of exaltation often laced with humour they revel in word play and are always sung with conviction in kenny's beautiful revealing emotional vocals as the albums poured forth three or four a year initially released on his own fence label so the fence collective grew a gang of bands and artists drawn to kenny's love for the underdog about as far from corporate polish as can be imagined a friends gig or festival would usually be in a village hall in fife often in anstruther with five or six bands on the bill musicians joining in with the others set kenny on the sound fisher and donaldson fudge donut sustaining the audience king creosote's reputation grew beyond the east neuk of fife he briefly flirted with commercial success with the album bombshell and in 2011 he was nominated for the mercury music prize for his collaboration with john hopkins diamond mine kenny has said that he writes songs with the nostalgia built in and so he was the perfect choice to write the evocative music for from scotland with love a beautiful and moving documentary released in documentary film released in 2014 featuring archive film of scots at work in dance halls playing as children on the streets on holiday at the seaside or leaving for a new life still writing performing and recording king creosote continues to give pleasure to audiences in fife and far beyond in songs rooted in the lives of people we would

be one of the greatest lorion addresses of all time thank you i'd also like to thank the senatus academic plus who have somehow agreed to confer this doctorate on yours truly and in particular the anonymous barty crouch whoever he or she is who stuck my name into the goblet of fire i thought bartley crouch was one of the good guys but my daughter louis tells me otherwise so apologies if i've upset that i could do i'd also like to thank my mum and dad one of my earliest memories one of my earliest magical memories is of my dad dragging an accordion off into the sunset amidst like a flurry of slamming doors and exhaust fumes and tyres squealing and then head return many hours after my bedtime with this cohort of troubadours that were all singing and smoking and drinking and swearing and i would sit at the top of the stairs thinking this has to be the life for me and then my mum would have to send me back to bed and then with a nocturnal dad some of you may have nocturnal dad but then my mum had to do the day job so she got us to school got me off to the boys brigade even yesterday found me a white bow tie that's my mom and but neither of them put any pressure on me to do well at school and as a thrown individual i chose to do quite well at school i had a very good short term memory and i loved what was happening outside the window so in 1985 i left edinburgh university with a degree much like you guys today and decided that it was time for me to drag my own accordion off in the sunset and i've been doing that for 33 years mine and boy so regards some advice for y'all i'm gonna say good luck you've all proved that you can use your brains you've proved that to yourselves to your mum and dad to the senators academic with but maybe as you go forward in your lives maybe listen to your hearts and because that's where the magic lies it's in the heart so yeah thank you so so much and good luck we all get there in the end thank you i call upon the assistant vice principal dean of of learning and teaching professor frank lawrence mueller nowhere near as charming i'm afraid vice chancellor's colleagues honoured guests and above all dear freshly confirmed graduates of the university of saint andrews graduation addresses usually begin with congratulations to those who have just received their degrees today however i want to start with a heartfelt expression of gratitude to our former students to their families and friends on behalf of everyone who works for this fine university i'd like to thank you all for making the effort to return here to celebrate your years at saint andrews with us we are not kidding ourselves about how easy it is to get here there is effectively one rd into saint andrews and that one rd routinely clogs clogs up at guardbridge the rail network gave up on us in 1969 and as for docking your cruise ship down in the harbour forget it so we do not get a lot of passing trade if you are in saint andrews that's because you wanted to come here and you were not put off by the journey that makes the compliment you're paying the university by being here today very special your happiness you're just pride in your achievements your conspicuous talents your ability to cross the stage without causing structural damage to this refurbished hall and your impeccable death sense all of this adds lustre to the occasion and reminds all of us on this side of the stage and the many helpers behind the scenes what our work is really about it is about supporting generation after generation of remarkable young individuals to grow in confidence maturity knowledge skillfulness and scholarly acumen it is our sincere wish that we can make this process as happy and fulfilling as possible for our students we also hope that in the course of their time and sandrews they will succeed in becoming active parts of a community whose members support and learn from each other your role in today's ceremony amounts to more though than just a welcome indication that your time in saint andrews has left you connected to the university to the town to each other it also forms a part of an ongoing building process more than a century ago the great french thinker emil durkheim the father of the academic discipline of sociology pointed out how important rituals were for giving cohesion to social groups he observed that rituals generate a shared ecstasy that was needed to affirm collectively held beliefs now i guess this is all a bit tame for ecstasy but this does not take away from the fact that though we are here to affirm joyously if not yet ecstatically some of our most important shared beliefs we still need to spell them out that learning and academic achievement should be celebrated at such moments of celebration should be shared with those to whom we are indebted for their love support and trust our families and friends and that we acknowledge and respect the work and learning of those who have come before us and hope to pass on to the current and to future generations a world in which untrammeled learning for the benefit of all will be possible and will continue to be cherished the splendid ritual serves to make these messages more enchanting and unforgettable but if it does not serve 2 tires all more into a community by inviting us to reflect on and affirm the beliefs that are important to us then this wonderful event would be somewhat less special in this summer of 2022 we have more reason than ever to reflect on the value of community and on how we express our communal living for two years the covid pandemic put a stop to events like this it made us fearful of each other's breath and touch it banished us into our individual rooms and chained us to our laptops singers fell silent people stared nervously at carbon dioxide monitors and the greeting hello was largely replaced with a weary you're on mute we soon realized that this lack of direct human contact dulled our lives across the university we noticed that many students struggled with the sudden isolation with being cut off from their friendship groups and with having to study or by themselves students had to forego those old important community of community affirming rituals not just old favourites like snoozing together through an early morning lecture or packing into cafes at lunchtime but also practising presentations in front of each other or meeting up in person for revision or support groups let me add that it was not just students who suffered these privations but the whole university community we've all gone through tough times we've worried about sick loved ones that we were not allowed to visit or about our bored kids resenting the home schooling we inflicted on them and let us not forget that many families that belong to this university community were touched by serious illness and even loss it is not meant to belittle this pain when i say that there is some consolation to be drawn from looking back over these two years of covid misery from the glittering vantage point of this ceremony 1st we should note with some pride that we have come through this together all of us remain committed to our scholarly mission even when facing adversity the university tried its hardest to offer you the best teaching available and you generously repaid our efforts and rewarded yourselves with the greater achievement we are here to celebrate today you gained your degrees academic degrees from one of the finest universities in the world fair and square you demonstrated flexibility and genuity forbearance and tenacity you did yourselves proud but also your teachers and those here in this hall whose support and care have enabled you to grow into a successful resilient individuals for this ioffer you and them my whole heart of congratulations when contemplating our journey through the covid years we can draw some more solace from a famous dictum by the austrian british philosopher karl popper who declared that all life is problem solving following this line of thought the difficulties and challenges we had to confront and overcome did not really diminish our lives rather they presented us with an opportunity to respond to its call even more intensively it is important though not to lose sight of two realizations that absolutely belong here 1st that we must be sensitive when appreciating others problems and be ready to admire how everyone seeks to resolve them in their own fashion and secondly that we need to be able to offer and accept kindness and help to and from others in our problem solving lives we did well because we live in and draw strength from communities formed by many different helpful connections i'm sure that's equipped and prepared you will live well and solve many more problems to be honest looking at the world right now we urgently need some great problem solvers and you are the extraordinary individuals who will step up to the challenge no pressure but we're counting on you for that graduates of 2021 on behalf of the university of saint andrews i once again offer you our gratitude our heartfelt congratulations and every good wish for your future thanks please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti said kumon nebus nobis in secular secularism

Good morning everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929, the younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating across 609 years. Students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proven resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled. The pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the Universities Foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Penny Scholar in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. Walter Bauer, a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century Scotland, described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of Scottish History. Scotty Chronicle, which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination. The legend has it that Saint Louis was born in circa 300 AD and was a Bishop in Patras, Greece, when he was visited. Johnny evening, by an Angel who instructed him to take the bones of Saint Andrew's far from the reach of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. Saint Louis brought the relics, which constituted 121 kneecap, 1 humorous and Saint Andrews right hand to what Bauer describes as the islands situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun. And it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in Saint Andrews, which have proven so formative for contemporary Scotland, developed with Saint Andrew, later becoming the nation's patron St. The lyrical origins of our town and university imbued St. Andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a Crucible for literary creativity. Throughout its 600 years, Walter Bowers Mantle was assumed by two alumni. Later in the 15th century, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas, who graduated in 1479 and 1494, respectively, and who together? Constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern Scotland. Dunbar and Douglas's use of Scots was foundational for much literature that followed. Dunbar's poetry was amongst the first items printed in Scotland by the Edinburgh Printers, Chapman and Miller in 1508, and Douglas was the first translator of Vergil's Latin and neared into Scots, completing this in 1513. These were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university, including one who would become Principal of St. Leonards College, George Buchanan. The most significant Latin poet of his time, Buchanan Wills amongst many occupations are tutor to Mary, Queen of Scots and later King James, the 6th of Scotland, and he served as a poet at Mary's Court, in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks, including a special Commission for the wedding of Mary to Lord Darnley. In 1565 later generations were equally influential. The first major printed anthology of Scottish Latin poetry, delici Portalarium Scoutorama, was sponsored by a graduate and early philanthropist of our university, John Scott, in 1637. And while we cannot claim to have educated Robert Burns who lived degree less to his end days, Saint Andrews was the academic home of the Scottish poet Robert Ferguson, who studied here from 17. 65 to 1768 and whom Burns held in higher esteem than all other writers. Literary life thrived in more recent centuries, and literary translation in particular was taken up by Willa Muir, an early female graduate of our university in 1910, who with her husband Edwin, translated works by such luminaries as Herman Brooke and Franz Kafka. The literary culture that the mules perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of English, which today hosts some of the world's foremost literary scholars. Alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners, we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets, dramatists and creatives, including Professor Don Patterson OBE Professor John Burnside, and Professor Zinnie Harris, whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalises upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and I'm invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in June or July 2021. And thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred, with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I will use to confirm the degrees, will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Dean's intern to present candidates from their respective faculties and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirm the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this, I place upon you this CAP. To most though, I will simply say at Super Tay's meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our veterans Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Kenny Anderson. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is the assistant vice principal Dean of learning and teaching professor Frank Lorenz Mueller. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews, and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

Gray all that's left. God. I call upon the university chaplain, Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen. Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Music on Oras Kausa Kenny Anderson. Kenny Anderson or King Creosote the name under which he performs is a singer and songwriter born in Saint Andrews. A recording artist who has released over 40 albums. And a tireless supporter and promoter of music. The last time I saw King Creosote on this very stage. Was at a festival called the Eye of the Dog in 2012 when he played alongside fellow St. Andrew and Katie Tunstall. I doubt that he or anyone else that day expected he would return here on an occasion like this in the town. He has always loved. And which has inspired so much of his music. Kenny was brought up in a musical household. His father, Billy Anderson, is an accordionist bandleader and teacher and his brothers Ian and Gordon, have also had musical careers. Kenny attended the local secondary school Madras College and then studied electronics and electrical engineering at Edinburgh University. But his heart was in music and on graduating he busked his way across Europe, forming the skiffle group. The scooby-doo orchestra. When that ended, as did a later band called the Khartoum Heroes. Great names aren't they? Kenny became a solo artist, performing and recording songs from 1998 on acoustic guitar and accordion. Often at home, drawing on folk and electronica with tape loops and samples. Making something uniquely his own. Can creosote songs touch on the realities of ordinary lives relationships gone awry? False starts and wrong turnings. Struggles in mind. And moments of exaltation. Often laced with humour, they revel in Word play. And are always sung with conviction in Kenny's beautiful revealing. Emotional vocals. As the albums poured forth three or four a year initially released on his own fence label, so the Fence Collective grew a gang of bands and artists drawn to Kenny's Love for the underdog. About as far from corporate Polish as can be imagined, a friends gig or festival would usually be in a village hall in Fife, often in Anstruther with five or six bands on the bill. Musicians joining in with the others. Set Kenny on the sound Fisher and Donaldson Fudge donut sustaining the audience. King Creosote's reputation grew beyond the east Neuk of Fife. He briefly flirted with commercial success with the album bombshell, and in 2011 he was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize for his collaboration with John Hopkins Diamond Mine. Kenny has said. That he writes songs with the nostalgia built in. And so he was the perfect choice to write the evocative music for from Scotland with love. A beautiful and moving documentary released in documentary film released in 2014 featuring archive film of Scots at work in dance halls, playing as children on the streets on holiday at the Seaside. Or leaving for a new life. Still writing, performing and recording King Creosote continues to give pleasure to audiences in Fife and far beyond in songs rooted in the lives of people, we would usually call unsung. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to music and culture in Scotland. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Music on orders Kausa on Kenny Anderson. It's great movement. More applause in a minute. Tea, Edgardo Doctoris music eye honoris causa from movie Curious Ray in Symbolum Superette hope britam imponent. Hey. Who? Well, thank you Donald. That has to be one of the greatest lorion addresses of all time. Thank you. I'd also like to thank the Senatus academic plus. Who have somehow agreed to confer this doctorate on yours truly, and in particular, the anonymous Barty Crouch, whoever he or she is who stuck my name into the Goblet of fire. I thought Bartley Crouch was one of the good guys, but my daughter Louis tells me otherwise, so apologies. If I've upset that I could do. I'd also like to thank my mum and dad. One of my earliest memories. One of my earliest magical memories is of my dad dragging an accordion off into the sunset. Amidst like a flurry of slamming doors and exhaust fumes and tyres squealing and then head. Return many hours after my bedtime with this cohort of troubadours that were all singing and smoking and drinking and swearing, and I would sit at the top of the stairs thinking this has to be the life for me. And then my mum would have to send me back to bed and then with a nocturnal dad, some of you may have nocturnal dad. But then my mum had to do the day job so she got us to school, got me off to the boys brigade even yesterday. Found me a white bow tie. That's my mom and but neither of them put any pressure on me to do well at school and as a thrown individual I chose to do quite well. At school, I had a very good short term memory and I loved what was happening outside the window. So in 1985 I left Edinburgh University with a degree much like you guys today and decided that it was time for me to drag my own accordion off in the sunset and I've been doing that for 33 years. Mine and boy. So regards some advice for y'all. I'm gonna say good luck. You've all proved that you can use your brains. You've proved that to yourselves, to your mum and dad, to the senators academic with. But maybe as you go forward in your lives, maybe listen to your hearts. And because that's where the magic lies, it's in the heart. So yeah, thank you so so much and. Good luck, we all get there in the end. Thank you. I call upon the Assistant vice principal Dean of of learning and teaching Professor Frank Lawrence Mueller. Nowhere near as charming, I'm afraid. Vice Chancellor's colleagues honoured guests and, above all dear, freshly confirmed graduates of the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation addresses usually begin with congratulations to those who have just received their degrees. Today, however, I want to start with a heartfelt expression of gratitude to our former students, to their families and friends. On behalf of everyone who works for this fine university, I'd like to thank you all for making the effort to return here to celebrate your years at Saint Andrews with us. We are not kidding ourselves about how easy it is to get here. There is effectively one Rd into Saint Andrews and that one Rd routinely clogs clogs up at guardbridge. The rail network gave up on us in 1969 and As for docking your cruise ship down in the harbour, forget it so we do not get a lot of passing trade if you are in Saint Andrews that's because you wanted to come here and you were not. Put off by the journey. That makes the compliment you're paying the university by being here today very special. Your happiness. You're just pride in your achievements. Your conspicuous talents, your ability to cross the stage without causing structural damage to this refurbished hall and your impeccable death sense. All of this adds lustre to the occasion and reminds all of us on this side of the stage and the many helpers behind the scenes. What our work is really about. It is about supporting generation after generation of remarkable young individuals to grow in confidence, maturity, knowledge, skillfulness and scholarly acumen. It is our sincere wish that we can make this process as happy and fulfilling as possible for our students. We also hope that in the course of their time and sandrews they will succeed in becoming active parts of a community whose members support and learn from each other. Your role in today's ceremony amounts to more though than just a welcome indication that your time in Saint Andrews has left you connected to the university to the town to each other. It also forms a part of an ongoing building process. More than a century ago, the great French thinker Emil Durkheim, the father of the academic discipline of sociology, pointed out how important rituals were for giving cohesion to social groups. He observed that rituals generate a shared ecstasy that was needed to affirm collectively held beliefs. Now I guess this is all a bit tame for ecstasy, but this does not take away from the fact that. Though we are here to affirm joyously. If not yet, ecstatically some of our most important shared beliefs, we still need to spell them out. That learning and academic achievement should be celebrated. At such moments of celebration should be shared with those to whom we are indebted for their love, support, and trust. Our families and friends. And that we acknowledge and respect the work and learning of those who have come before us and hope to pass on to the current and to future generations. A world in which untrammeled learning for the benefit of all will be possible. And will continue to be cherished. The splendid ritual serves to make these messages more enchanting and unforgettable. But if it does not serve 2 tires all more into a community by inviting us to reflect on and affirm the beliefs that are important to us, then this wonderful event. Would be somewhat less special. In this summer of 2022, we have more reason than ever to reflect on the value of Community and on how we express our communal living. For two years, the COVID pandemic put a stop to events like this. It made us fearful of each other's breath and touch. It banished us into our individual rooms and chained us to our laptops. Singers fell silent. People stared nervously at carbon dioxide monitors and the greeting hello was largely replaced with a weary you're on mute. We soon realized that this lack of direct human contact dulled our lives across the university. We noticed that many students struggled with the sudden isolation with being cut off from their friendship groups and with having to study or by themselves. Students had to forego those old important community of community affirming rituals, not just old favourites like snoozing together through an early morning lecture or packing into cafes at lunchtime, but also practising presentations in front of each other or meeting up in person for revision or support groups. Let me add that it was not just students who suffered these privations, but the whole university community. We've all gone through tough times. We've worried about sick loved ones that we were not allowed to visit, or about our bored kids resenting the home schooling we inflicted on them? And let us not forget that many families that belong to this university community were touched by serious illness and even loss. It is not meant to belittle this pain when I say that there is some consolation to be drawn from looking back over these two years of COVID misery from the glittering vantage point of this ceremony. 1st. We should note with some pride that we have come through this together. All of us remain committed to our scholarly mission even when facing adversity. The university tried its hardest to offer you the best teaching available, and you generously repaid our efforts and rewarded yourselves with the greater achievement. We are here to celebrate today. You gained your degrees academic degrees from one of the finest universities in the World, Fair and square. You demonstrated flexibility and Genuity forbearance and tenacity you did yourselves proud, but also your teachers and those here in this hall whose support and care have enabled you to grow into a successful, resilient individuals for this ioffer you and them my whole heart of congratulations. When contemplating our journey through the COVID years, we can draw some more solace from a famous dictum by the Austrian, British philosopher Karl Popper, who declared that all life is problem solving. Following this line of thought, the difficulties and challenges we had to confront and overcome did not really diminish our lives. Rather, they presented us with an opportunity. To respond to its call even more intensively. It is important, though not to lose sight of two realizations that absolutely belong here. 1st that we must be sensitive when appreciating others problems and be ready to admire how everyone seeks to resolve them in their own fashion. And secondly that we need to be able to offer and accept kindness and help to and from others in our problem solving lives. We did well because we live in and draw strength from communities formed by many different helpful connections. I'm sure that's equipped and prepared. You will live well and solve many more problems. To be honest, looking at the world right now, we urgently need some great problem solvers and you are the extraordinary individuals who will step up to the challenge. No pressure, but we're counting on you. For that graduates of 2021 on behalf of the University of Saint Andrews, I once again offer you our gratitude. Our heartfelt congratulations and every good wish for your future. Thanks. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, said Kumon Nebus nobis in secular secularism Amen."
