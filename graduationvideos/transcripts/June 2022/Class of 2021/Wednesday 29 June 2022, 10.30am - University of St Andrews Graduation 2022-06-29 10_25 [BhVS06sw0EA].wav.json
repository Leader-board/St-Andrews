graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were held online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage inner style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from penny scholar in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later of the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king robert the third and later as tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for eighteen years king james returned and visited saint andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas here in fourteen twenty five and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the sixth of scotland and first of england visited saint andrews in sixteen seventeen and made a gift of two hundred volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in sixteen forty three on south street this was a key moment for the early library but one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary's college from fifteen eighty and as rector from fifteen ninety melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national lives throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen 's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in two thousand and five we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may twenty twenty one and earlier this month we unveiled a fortieth birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the universities ward law museum our recently redeveloped museum situated on the schools and which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and change makers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fifth to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is one from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will follow immediately after this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty one was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july twenty twenty one and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelor 's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans intern to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor sharon ashbrook from the school of chemistry the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to

superette hope beretta compono draw i call upon professor sharon ashbrook of the school of chemistry vice chancellor 's honoured guests colleagues and graduates welcome to this graduation ceremony and to this very special day here in saint andrews let me start by offering all of you who've celebrated their graduation today my warmest congratulations on your success all of us here are incredibly proud of everything that you've achieved this is the second time i've been asked to do a graduation address for the first i followed fairly traditional lines i talked about the hard work that it takes to complete a degree explained how the graduating class hadn't achieved their success alone with help from the academic staff and significant support from their families and friends i also talked about the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead as the graduates moved on from saint andrews by definition then this address has to be a little different given the backdrop of the global pandemic against which it's set and which has caused a significant delay to your graduation ceremony we should of course still highlight all your hard work perhaps even more so given the difficult circumstances under which your degrees have been obtained and it's true that you didn't achieve these alone although the pandemic way may well have made some of you feel more alone than you'd anticipated you've coped with virtual access to academic staff for long periods and all of you will have missed that day-to-day support from your peers and classmates you probably didn't realize how reassuring it was to leave a lecture theatre and hear that no one else had understood the last ten minutes of the lecture either and of course the delay to this ceremony means that you've already taken those next daunting but very exciting steps pandemic then has been difficult for all of us probably in different ways some of us have lost loved ones miss kevin events in the lives of our families and friends some will have struggled personally perhaps with our physical health or with our mental health as with all challenges though the pandemic has taught us valuable lessons lessons about our communities about our relationships and about ourselves i've learned a lot and a lot about myself i've learned how much i prefer in person teaching despite the considerable stress that i feel before any live lecture i've learned how much i value the face to face interactions with my research group and my colleagues i learned how much i missed watching live football i learned how easy it was to spend a lot of money very quickly on online shopping and that perhaps there is a maximum number of soft furnishings that are one bedroom flats should have the pandemic though did teach me one thing about myself that i would like to share with you today anyone in the audience or on the stage you knows me well well know that i like a bit of organization i i like a plan i have to do lists of to do lists i write conference talks and months in advance i turn up hours early for trains let alone for planes to the irritation of some of my chemistry colleagues behind me i really don't like unexpected changes the pandemic of course forced a change in all of this however what i found was that i was much more resilient and i was much more adaptable than i'd ever thought i could be i changed how and what i taught at very short notice change it back again that even shorter notice when trouble was disrupted i didn't panic well maybe just a bit but i rethought replanned and rebooked when things were cancelled as many things were quickly realized that it wasn't worth regretting what i couldn't do and i just looked forwards to what i might be able to do next it's great for us all then in life to have plans aims and goals but these need to be flexible and adaptable the need to adapt to changing circumstances to allow you to take advantage of new and unexpected opportunities when things don't go to plan as many things won't in life there's no point dwelling on what might have been rethink replan and look forward to the next opportunity as you leave here today then i'd encourage you to think about the resilience and adaptability that the pandemic has forced all of you to find within yourselves reflect on how much you've achieved in the most difficult of times use that resilience and exploit it as you move forwards in the next stages of your careers and your lives you leave of course with our very best wishes for the future we hope that you're successful in everything that you do but more than that we hope that you're happy we look forward to hearing about all of your achievements and celebrating those with you so finally congratulations once again and i hope that you all enjoy the rest of your day please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism amen",

graduates welcome to this graduation ceremony and to this very special day here in saint andrews let me start by offering all of you who've celebrated their graduation today my warmest congratulations on your success all of us here are incredibly proud of everything that you've achieved this is the second time i've been asked to do a graduation address for the first i followed fairly traditional lines i talked about the hard work that it takes to complete a degree explained how the graduating class hadn't achieved their success alone with help from the academic staff and significant support from their families and friends i also talked about the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead as the graduates moved on from saint andrews by definition then this address has to be a little different given the backdrop of the global pandemic against which it's set and which has caused a significant delay to your graduation ceremony we should of course still highlight all your hard work perhaps even more so given the difficult circumstances under which your degrees have been obtained and it's true that you didn't achieve these alone although the pandemic way may well have made some of you feel more alone than you'd anticipated you've coped with virtual access to academic staff for long periods and all of you will have missed that day-to-day support from your peers and classmates you probably didn't realize how reassuring it was to leave a lecture theatre and hear that no one else had understood the last 10 minutes of the lecture either and of course the delay to this ceremony means that you've already taken those next daunting but very exciting steps pandemic then has been difficult for all of us probably in different ways some of us have lost loved ones miss kevin events in the lives of our families and friends some will have struggled personally perhaps with our physical health or with our mental health as with all challenges though the pandemic has taught us valuable lessons lessons about our communities about our relationships and about ourselves i've learned a lot and a lot about myself i've learned how much i prefer in person teaching despite the considerable stress that i feel before any live lecture i've learned how much i value the face to face interactions with my research group and my colleagues i learned how much i missed watching live football i learned how easy it was to spend a lot of money very quickly on online shopping and that perhaps there is a maximum number of soft furnishings that are one bedroom flats should have the pandemic though did teach me one thing about myself that i would like to share with you today anyone in the audience or on the stage you knows me well well know that i like a bit of organization i i like a plan i have to do lists of to do lists i write conference talks and months in advance i turn up hours early for trains let alone for planes to the irritation of some of my chemistry colleagues behind me i really don't like unexpected changes the pandemic of course forced a change in all of this however what i found was that i was much more resilient and i was much more adaptable than i'd ever thought i could be i changed how and what i taught at very short notice change it back again that even shorter notice when trouble was disrupted i didn't panic well maybe just a bit but i rethought replanned and rebooked when things were cancelled as many things were quickly realized that it wasn't worth regretting what i couldn't do and i just looked forwards to what i might be able to do next it's great for us all then in life to have plans aims and goals but these need to be flexible and adaptable the need to adapt to changing circumstances to allow you to take advantage of new and unexpected opportunities when things don't go to plan as many things won't in life there's no point dwelling on what might have been rethink replan and look forward to the next opportunity as you leave here today then i'd encourage you to think about the resilience and adaptability that the pandemic has forced all of you to find within yourselves reflect on how much you've achieved in the most difficult of times use that resilience and exploit it as you move forwards in the next stages of your careers and your lives you leave of course with our very best wishes for the future we hope that you're successful in everything that you do but more than that we hope that you're happy we look forward to hearing about all of your achievements and celebrating those with you so finally congratulations once again and i hope that you all enjoy the rest of your day please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum

Good morning everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer's graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were held online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage inner style. That unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Penny Scholar in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. The royal leaders of Scotland and later of the United Kingdom have been a guiding, enriching and at times challenging presence in our history. Saint Andrews was the spiritual home of Scotland and on occasion hosted the Scottish Court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the Royal household. Our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, served as an adviser and diplomat to King Robert the 3rd and later as tutor and Protector to his son, the future King James, the first of Scotland, who resided with him in Saint Andrews Castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to France, which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in England for 18 years. King James returned and visited St. Andrews throughout his life celebrating Christmas here in 1425, and he was so enamored by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to Perth. His request was dutifully and happily ignored. Our university library, the oldest continuous library in Scotland, is indebted to royal patronage. King James, the 6th of Scotland and 1st of England visited St. Andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the University Library, a building in his honour. To accommodate this collection, the King James Library was completed in 1643 on South St. This was a key moment for the early library, but one suspects that King James was overcompensating for previous offence. Earlier in his reign, King James clashed repeatedly with Andrew Melville, a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as Principal of Saint Mary's College from 1580 and as rector from 1590. Melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university, but was resistant to royal interference. Given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether, King James locked Melville in the Tower of London. Royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to Lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national lives throughout its existence. We enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating Her Majesty the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. We have been honoured by the presence of Her Majesty periodically throughout her reign, most recently at the graduation of our alumni, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a graduation ceremony just like this one in 2005. We were delighted to welcome their Royal Highnesses back to the university for a visit in May 2021 and earlier this month, we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge at the Universities Ward Law Museum. Our recently redeveloped museum, situated on the schools and which is well worth a visit. In crossing today's stage, each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps, but also in the footsteps of the academics, leaders and change makers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of 5th to shape the world in profound ways. The journey you make from here is yours to envisage, but their example is 1, from which we can all draw inspiration. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears. The first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will follow immediately after this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in June or July 2021, and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way, although the Latin, which I will use. To confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at Bachelor's Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans intern to present candidates from their respective faculties and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirm the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this, I place upon you this CAP. To most though, I will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our veterans Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is professor Sharon Ashbrook from the School of Chemistry. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. And you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

Vice Chancellor's honoured guests. Colleagues and graduates welcome to this graduation ceremony and to this very special day here in Saint Andrews. Let me start by offering all of you who've celebrated their graduation today my warmest congratulations on your success. All of us here are incredibly proud of everything that you've achieved. This is the second time I've been asked to do a graduation address. For the first, I followed fairly traditional lines. I talked about the hard work that it takes to complete a degree. Explained how the graduating class hadn't achieved their success alone with help from the academic staff and significant support from their families and friends. I also talked about the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead as the graduates moved on from Saint Andrews. By definition, then, this address has to be a little different given the backdrop of the global pandemic against which it's set and which has caused a significant delay to your graduation ceremony. We should of course still highlight all your hard work, perhaps even more so, given the difficult circumstances under which your degrees have been obtained. And it's true that you didn't achieve these alone. Although the pandemic way may well have made some of you feel more alone than you'd anticipated. You've coped with virtual access to academic staff for long periods, and all of you will have missed that day-to-day support from your peers and classmates. You probably didn't realize how reassuring it was to leave a lecture theatre and hear that no one else had understood the last 10 minutes of the lecture either. And of course, the delay to this ceremony means that you've already taken those next daunting but very exciting steps. Pandemic then has been difficult for all of us, probably in different ways. Some of us have lost loved ones. Miss Kevin events in the lives of our families and friends. Some will have struggled personally, perhaps with our physical health or with our mental health. As with all challenges, though, the pandemic has taught us valuable lessons lessons about our communities, about our relationships, and about ourselves. I've learned a lot and a lot about myself. I've learned how much I prefer in person teaching. Despite the considerable stress that I feel before any live lecture. I've learned how much I value the face to face interactions with my research group and my colleagues. I learned how much I missed watching live football. I learned how easy it was to spend a lot of money very quickly on online shopping. And that perhaps there is a maximum number of soft furnishings that are one. Bedroom flats should have. The pandemic though did teach me one thing about myself that I would like to share with you today. Anyone in the audience or on the stage you knows me? Well, well know that I like a bit of organization I I like a plan. I have to do lists of to do lists I write conference talks and months in advance. I turn up hours early for trains, let alone for planes to the irritation of some of my chemistry colleagues behind me. I really don't like unexpected changes. The pandemic, of course forced a change in all of this. However, what I found was that I was much more resilient and I was much more adaptable than I'd ever thought I could be. I changed how and what I taught at very short notice. Change it back again that even shorter notice. When trouble was disrupted, I didn't panic. Well, maybe just a bit, but I rethought. Replanned and rebooked. When things were cancelled, as many things were. Quickly realized that it wasn't worth regretting what I couldn't do, and I just looked forwards to what I might be able to do next. It's great for us all then in life to have plans, aims and goals, but these need to be flexible and adaptable. The need to adapt to changing circumstances to allow you to take advantage of new and unexpected opportunities. When things don't go to plan, as many things won't in life. There's no point dwelling on what might have been. Rethink Replan and look forward to the next opportunity. As you leave here today, then I'd encourage you to think about the resilience and adaptability that the pandemic has forced all of you to find within yourselves. Reflect on how much you've achieved in the most difficult of times. Use that resilience and exploit it as you move forwards in the next stages of your careers and your lives. You leave, of course, with our very best wishes for the future. We hope that you're successful in everything that you do, but more than that, we hope that you're happy. We look forward to hearing about all of your achievements and celebrating those with you. So finally congratulations once again and I hope that you all enjoy the rest of your day. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti, Sitkum omnibus nobis. In secular secularism. Amen."
