this historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson sarma ceremonies after a three year period in which they were held online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and

nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations has been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the young the hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued paypal bill bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february walter bauer a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of fifteenth century scotland described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of scottish history scotty chronicon which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination legend has it that saint rue was born in circa three hundred AD and was a bishop in patras greece when he was visited on the evening by an angel who instructed him to take the bones of saint andrew far from the reach of the roman emperor constantine the great saint louis brought the relics which constituted one tooth one kneecap one humorous and saint andrews right hand to what bauer describes as the islands situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities in saint andrews which have proven so formative for contemporary scotland developed with saint andrew later becoming the nation 's patron saint the lyrical origins of our town and university imbued saint andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a crucible for literary creativity throughout its six hundred years walter bowers mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the fifteenth century william dunbar and gavin douglas who graduated in fourteen seventy nine and fourteen ninety four respectively and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early modern scotland dunbar and douglas 's use of scots was foundational for march literature that followed dunbars pertry was amongst the first items printed in scotland by the edinburgh printers chapman and miller and douglas was the first translator of vergil's latin enyd into scots completing this in fifteen thirteen these were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university including one who would become principal of saint leonards college george buchanan the most significant latin poet of his time buchanan was amongst many occupations a tutor to mary queen of scots and later king james the sixth of scotland and he served as a poet at mary's court in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks including a special commission for the wedding of mary to lord darnley in fifteen sixty five later generations were equally influential the first major printed anthology of scottish latin poetry delici putaruru scoutorama was sponsored by a graduate and early philanthropist of our university john scott in sixteen thirty seven and while we cannot claim to have educated robert burns who lived agrilus to his end days saint andrews was the academic home of the scottish poet robert ferguson who studied here from seventeen sixty five to seventeen sixty eight and whom burns held in higher esteem than all other writers literary life thrived in more recent centuries and literary translation in particular was taken up by willa muir an early female graduate of our university in nineteen ten who with her husband edwin translated works by such luminaries as herman brooke and and franz kafka the literary culture that the mures perpetuated complemented the research activities of our school of english which today has some of the world 's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners we are highly distinctive in accommodating poets dramatists and creatives including professor don patterson OBE professor john burnside and professor zinnie harris whose combination of creative ingenuity with critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as hent salvatore's chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognizes that the class of twenty twenty one was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that poor city of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july twenty twenty one and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i would use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say get super tay meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews taylor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour professor carlo ginsberg to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is doctor simon prosser from the school of philosophical anthropological and film studies the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and who support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life decanus facilitates artsiom vice chancellor i ask you to confirm the degree

university of bologna at the university of california los angeles and at the squalor normalite superiori of pisa he's made influential contributions not only to early modern history but also to art history philosophy and literary studies his interests ranged widely from italian renaissance art to seventeenth century livonian warewolves and to all of his studies he brings an intellectual creativity a historical sensibility and a literary verve that have inspired generations of students carla was famed above all as a pioneer of micro history an analytical approach that presents an intensive study of a particular event individual or community placing it under the historical microscope the cheese and the worms first published in nineteen seventy six and today translated into more than twenty languages reconstructed the extraordinary world view of a sixteenth century italian miller known as manocchio who was sentenced to death by the inquisition for his unorthodox beliefs it demonstrated carlos determination to make the persecuted and vanquished the focus of his research and confirmed his passion for anomalies exceptions and deviations from the historical norm already in his first book the night battles published in nineteen sixty six carla had captured in exciting and innovative ways the attitudes and experiences of men and women living beyond the boundaries of elite high culture he analyzed the beliefs of the ben and dante or good walkers a group of sixteenth century freely and peasants who claim to go out at night to fight witches and ensure the fertility of crops here and in his later ecstasies carlo salvage fragments of an obliterated peasant culture through his brilliant reading of hostile sources trial records produced by the inquisition no historian can now ignore his call to go beyond the inquisitors deforming perspective when studying early modern popular culture moreover colour himself played a role in the opening up of the vatican 's inquisition archives to researchers during the nineteen nineties alongside these key works of early modern scholarship carlo has also been a methodological innovator writing about the nature of historical evidence and the concept of historical proof in his most recent coauthored work old teeth he explores the self understanding of a seventeenth century livonian peasant known in his village as a werewolf the book presents multiple readings of tisas story reflecting on the role of the historian and demonstrating the importance of scholarly exchange here and throughout his work carlo shows us that the historians craft consists of intellectual openness to the unexpected and of detective work combined with careful reading painstaking research and meticulous attention to detail in nineteen ninety two color was awarded the abb varberg prize by the city of hamburg in two thousand and seven he received the humboldt research prize acknowledging a lifetime of achievement and in two thousand and ten he won the boltzmann prize for european history in recognition of the exceptional combination of imagination scholarly precision and literary skill with which he's recovered and illuminated the beliefs of ordinary people in early modern europe vice chancellor in recognition of his major contribution to his school historical scholarship i invite you to confer the degree of doctor of letters on orders kauser on professor carlo ginzburg take in gradu doctoris litteram on oris causa preview curious ray in symbolum superette hope britam imponent this is a great honor indeed i am deeply moved and deeply grateful to the university of saint andrews the vice chancellor to all those who made this recognition to my work possible and i'm grateful to bridget for a generous words yeah she's right in emphasizing the fact that i worked across disciplines actually it would which i dislike and i used to say that history as a cognitive approach should not be regarded as a fortress closed in itself but as an airport from which you may leave in different directions but it's also true that retrospectively i can find a common element in my trajectory my first essay which i published a long time ago ended with a centre saying more or less not it was a based on a witchcraft trial which took place in moderna northern italy against a peasant woman kiara signorini who had been ejected by landlady because she said that kerosene was a witch and they had put a charm against her so at the end of my work on that trial i said notwithstanding the specificity of this trial i think that it has a paradigmatic value so years ago i read again that that essay in that sentence and i thought well keys it's a case which has a paradigmatic value and then paradigmatic and i thought well obviously this was an echo of thomas koons destructure of scientific revolution but i was wrong actually my essay was published one year before thomas koons work so paradigmatic meant exemplary and i think that i've been working on anomalous exemplary cases until today thank you very much i call upon doctor simon prosser of the school of philosophical anthropological and film studies vice chancellor colleagues graduates and special guests congratulations to all our new graduates we are all delighted for you and you should feel very proud of what you have achieved during your time with us this is of course an unusual graduation ceremony since most of you graduating finished your studies a year ago i do hope things have gone very well during the last year and we are delighted that you were able to come back to saint andrews to see us again and to join us in celebrating your achievements there is no doubt that you finished your degree during an extraordinary period of history as much for this institution as elsewhere i hope that when you look back in the years to come that last rather difficult part of your time with us doesn't dominate your memories at the newstead you'll still have vivid memories of making new friends from all around the world and have phone fights in the quad and of that feeling of satisfaction when that piece of laboratory apparatus that you've been struggling with finally produced a graph that was the right shape and of conversations about politics and philosophy on long walks on the west sands and not just memories of suddenly realising that you'd forgotten to blur the background while attending a class on microsoft teams from a rather messy bedroom or of your lecturer doing the same well this is the first time i've been asked to give a graduation address and i must admit that my immediate reaction was to feel honoured but also slightly terrified but you know the opportunities that seem scary to us are very often the ones that we ought to accept because very often those are the ones that will help us to grow there are so many ways in which people can grow during your time here we have watched you grow in many of these ways we grow when we gain knowledge and you've certainly done that but we also grow in other ways when we broaden our experiences and confront new challenges we become stronger and more confident in ourselves steadier on our feet better able to tackle what life throws at us it is an amazing thing for those of us who teach here to watch the transformation in students as they pass from their arrival is fresh as often just out of school sometimes awkwardly inarticulate to become the capable and impressive young adults that we see just four or five years later at graduation that transformation is not to be underestimated you leave as a quite different person to the one who arrived but we should never stop growing human beings like many other living things need to grow in order to flourish you should never let your life stagnate by just doing what you know and taking the safe options to grow we must embrace change accept new challenges challenges that will stretch us to our limits but make us better for it in your lives individually and collectively you may face many challenges some of them never faced by previous generations but in many ways you are better equipped than any previous generation to meet those challenges the knowledge and the intellectual training that you have acquired will stand you in good stead have trust in yourself embrace the changes and never stop growing but today's not about all that today is about you and what you've achieved during your time at this university i really hope you enjoy celebrating your achievements and i wish you all the very best for the future wherever your journey may take you stay in touch we're always happy to hear your news and always remember that we are immensely proud of you please stand for the benediction grazia

with an insatiable sense of curiosity over the course of his career spent at the university of bologna at the university of california los angeles and at the squalor normalite superiori of pisa he's made influential contributions not only to early modern history but also to art history philosophy and literary studies his interests ranged widely from italian renaissance art to 17th century livonian warewolves and to all of his studies he brings an intellectual creativity a historical sensibility and a literary verve that have inspired generations of students carla was famed above all as a pioneer of micro history an analytical approach that presents an intensive study of a particular event individual or community placing it under the historical microscope the cheese and the worms first published in 1976 and today translated into more than 20 languages reconstructed the extraordinary world view of a 16th century italian miller known as manocchio who was sentenced to death by the inquisition for his unorthodox beliefs it demonstrated carlos determination to make the persecuted and vanquished the focus of his research and confirmed his passion for anomalies exceptions and deviations from the historical norm already in his first book the night battles published in 1966 carla had captured in exciting and innovative ways the attitudes and experiences of men and women living beyond the boundaries of elite high culture he analyzed the beliefs of the ben and dante or good walkers a group of 16th century freely and peasants who claim to go out at night to fight witches and ensure the fertility of crops here and in his later ecstasies carlo salvage fragments of an obliterated peasant culture through his brilliant reading of hostile sources trial records produced by the inquisition no historian can now ignore his call to go beyond the inquisitors deforming perspective when studying early modern popular culture moreover colour himself played a role in the opening up of the vatican's inquisition archives to researchers during the 1990s alongside these key works of early modern scholarship carlo has also been a methodological innovator writing about the nature of historical evidence and the concept of historical proof in his most recent coauthored work old teeth he explores the self understanding of a 17th century livonian peasant known in his village as a werewolf the book presents multiple readings of tisas story reflecting on the role of the historian and demonstrating the importance of scholarly exchange here and throughout his work carlo shows us that the historians craft consists of intellectual openness to the unexpected and of detective work combined with careful reading painstaking research and meticulous attention to detail in 1992 color was awarded the abb varberg prize by the city of hamburg in 2007 he received the humboldt research prize acknowledging a lifetime of achievement and in 2010 he won the boltzmann prize

university of saint andrews the vice chancellor to all those who made this recognition to my work possible and i'm grateful to bridget for a generous words yeah she's right in emphasizing the fact that i worked across disciplines actually it would which i dislike and i used to say that history as a cognitive approach should not be regarded as a fortress closed in itself but as an airport from which you may leave in different directions but it's also true that retrospectively i can find a common element in my trajectory my first essay which i published a long time ago ended with a centre saying more or less not it was a based on a witchcraft trial which took place in moderna northern italy against a peasant woman kiara signorini who had been ejected by landlady because she said that kerosene was a witch and they had put a charm against her so at the end of my work on that trial i said notwithstanding the specificity of this trial i think that it has a paradigmatic value so years ago i read again that that essay in that sentence and i thought well keys it's a case which has a paradigmatic value and then paradigmatic and i thought well obviously this was an echo of thomas koons destructure of scientific revolution but i was wrong actually my essay was published one year before thomas koons work so paradigmatic meant exemplary and i think that i've been working on anomalous exemplary cases until today thank you very much i call upon doctor simon prosser of the school of philosophical anthropological and film studies vice chancellor colleagues graduates and special guests congratulations to all our new graduates we are all delighted for you and you should feel very proud of what you have achieved during your time with us this is of course an unusual graduation ceremony since most of you graduating finished your studies a year ago i do hope things have gone very well during the last year and we are delighted that you were able to come back to saint andrews to see us again and to join us in celebrating your achievements there is no doubt that you finished your degree during an extraordinary period of history as much for this institution as elsewhere i hope that when you look back in the years to come that last rather difficult part of your time with us doesn't dominate your memories at the newstead you'll still have vivid memories of making new friends from all around the world and have phone fights in the quad and of that feeling of satisfaction when that piece of laboratory apparatus that you've been struggling with finally produced a graph that was the right shape and of conversations about politics and philosophy on long walks on the west sands and not just memories of suddenly realising that you'd forgotten to blur the background while attending a class on microsoft teams from a rather messy bedroom or of your lecturer doing the same well this is the first time i've been asked to give a graduation address and i must admit that my immediate reaction was to feel honoured but also slightly terrified but you know the opportunities that seem scary to us are very often the ones that we ought to accept because very often those are the ones that will help us to grow there are so many ways in which people can grow during your time here we have watched you grow in many of these ways we grow when we gain knowledge and you've certainly done that but we also grow in other ways when we broaden our experiences and confront new challenges we become stronger and more confident in ourselves steadier on our feet better able to tackle what life throws at us it is an amazing thing for those of us who teach here to watch the transformation in students as they pass from their arrival is fresh as often just out of school sometimes awkwardly inarticulate to become the capable and impressive young adults that we see just four or five years later at graduation that transformation is not to be underestimated you leave as a quite different person to the one who arrived but we should never stop growing human beings like many other living things need to grow in order to flourish you should never let your life stagnate by just doing what you know and taking the safe options to grow we must embrace change accept new challenges challenges that will stretch us to our limits but make us better for it in your lives individually and collectively you may face many challenges some of them never faced by previous generations but in many ways you are better equipped than any previous generation to meet those challenges the knowledge and the intellectual training that you have acquired will stand you in good stead have trust in yourself embrace the changes and never stop growing but today's not about all that today is about you and what you've achieved during your time at this university i really hope you enjoy celebrating your achievements and i wish you all the very best for the future wherever your journey may take you stay in touch we're always happy to hear your news and always remember that we are immensely proud of you please stand for the benediction grazia domini nostri jesu christi at

Good morning everybody. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions, and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of Imperson Sarma ceremonies after a three year. In which they were held online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929, the younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations. Has been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the young the hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 13. 18 university instruction commenced here in May 1410 when our founder Bishop Henry Wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued PayPal, Bill Bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. Walter Bauer, a graduate of this university and the major chronicler of 15th century Scotland, described the foundation of our university in his chronicle of Scottish History. Scotty Chronicon, which also recounts the origins of the town and evinces its place at the heart of our cultural imagination. Legend has it that St Rue was born in circa 300 AD and was a Bishop in Patras, Greece, when he was visited. On the evening by an Angel who instructed him to take the bones of Saint Andrew, far from the reach of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. Saint Louis brought the relics, which constituted one tooth, 1 kneecap 1 humorous and Saint Andrews right hand to what Bauer describes as the islands situated in the ocean beneath the setting sun, and it is around these relics that the religious and academic communities. In Saint Andrews, which have proven so formative for contemporary Scotland, developed with Saint Andrew, later becoming the nation's patron St. The lyrical origins of our town and university imbued St. Andrews with a poetic sensibility that continues to this day and our community has been a Crucible for literary creativity. Throughout its 600 years. Walter Bowers Mantle was assumed by two alumni later in the 15th century, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas, who graduated in 1479 and 1494, respectively, and who together constitute two of the most significant poetic voices of early Modern Scotland. Dunbar, and Douglas's use of Scots was foundational for March literature that followed. Dunbars Pertry was amongst the first items printed in Scotland by the Edinburgh Printers, Chapman and Miller, and Douglas was the first translator of Vergil's Latin Enyd into Scots, completing this in 1513. These were the first in a long line of distinguished poets at our university, including one who would become Principal of St. Leonards. College George Buchanan. The most significant Latin poet of his time. Buchanan was amongst many occupations. A tutor to Mary, Queen of Scots, and later King James, the 6th of Scotland, and he served as a poet at Mary's Court, in which capacity he wrote many royal poems and masks, including a special Commission for the wedding of Mary to Lord Darnley in 1565. Later generations were equally influential, the 1st. Major printed anthology of Scottish Latin poetry, delici Putaruru Scoutorama was sponsored by a graduate and early philanthropist of our university, John Scott, in 1637, and while we cannot claim to have educated Robert Burns who lived agrilus to his end days, Saint Andrews was the academic home of the Scottish poet Robert Ferguson, who studied here from 1765 to 1768 and whom Burns held in higher esteem than all. Other writers. Literary life thrived in more recent centuries, and literary translation in particular was taken up by Willa Muir, an early female graduate of our university in 1910, who with her husband Edwin, translated works by such luminaries as Herman Brooke and and Franz Kafka. The literary culture that the Mures perpetuated complemented the research activities of our School of English, which today has some of the world's foremost literary scholars alongside some of its most celebrated literary practitioners. We are highly distinctive in accommodating poets, dramatists and creatives, including Professor Don Patterson OBE Professor John Burnside, and Professor Zinnie Harris, whose combination of creative ingenuity. With critical rigour capitalizes upon the uniquely artistic academic culture that has its origins in our foundation. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as Hent Salvatore's Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain. The Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognizes that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation, and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that poor city of quintessential festivities one year later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in June or July 2021, and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred, with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I would use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties, and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirmed the degree of Master of Arts and symbolise this. I place upon you this cap to most, though I will simply say. Get super Tay meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews Taylor, and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our veterans Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. Professor Carlo Ginsberg. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Doctor Simon Prosser from the School of Philosophical, Anthropological and Film Studies. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you are graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments, but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and who support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step. In your Saint Andrews experience, and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life.

Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Lettuce on orders on orders Cowser Professor Carlo Ginzburg. Carlo is a scholar with an insatiable sense of curiosity. Over the course of his career spent at the University of Bologna at the University of California, Los Angeles, and at the squalor, Normalite Superiori of Pisa, he's made influential contributions not only to early modern history, but also to art, history, philosophy, and literary studies. His interests ranged widely from Italian Renaissance art to 17th century Livonian Warewolves and to all of his studies he brings an intellectual creativity, a historical sensibility, and a literary verve that have inspired generations of students. Carla was famed above all as a pioneer of micro history, an analytical approach that presents an intensive study of a particular event, individual or community, placing it under the historical microscope. The cheese and the worms, first published in 1976 and today translated into more than 20 languages, reconstructed the extraordinary world view of a 16th century Italian Miller known as Manocchio, who was sentenced to death by the Inquisition for his unorthodox beliefs. It demonstrated Carlos determination to make the persecuted and vanquished the focus of his research, and confirmed his passion for anomalies, exceptions and deviations from the historical norm. Already in his first book, the Night Battles published in 1966, Carla had captured in exciting and innovative ways. The attitudes and experiences of men and women living beyond the boundaries of elite high culture. He analyzed the beliefs of the Ben and Dante or good Walkers, a group of 16th century, freely and peasants who claim to go out at night to fight witches and ensure the fertility of crops. Here and in his later ecstasies Carlo salvage fragments of an obliterated peasant culture through his brilliant reading of hostile sources. Trial records produced by the Inquisition. No historian can now ignore his call to go beyond the inquisitors, deforming perspective when studying early modern popular culture. Moreover, colour himself played a role in the opening up of the Vatican's Inquisition archives to researchers during the 1990s. Alongside these key works of early modern scholarship, Carlo has also been a methodological innovator, writing about the nature of historical evidence and the concept of historical proof. In his most recent coauthored work, old Teeth, he explores the self understanding of a 17th century Livonian peasant known in his village as a werewolf. The book presents multiple readings of Tisas story reflecting on the role of the historian and demonstrating the importance of scholarly exchange. Here and throughout his work, Carlo shows us that the historians craft consists of intellectual openness to the unexpected and of detective work, combined with careful reading, painstaking research and meticulous attention to detail. In 1992, color was awarded the ABB Varberg Prize by the city of Hamburg. In 2007 he received the Humboldt Research Prize, acknowledging a lifetime of achievement, and in 2010 he won the Boltzmann Prize for European History. In recognition of the exceptional combination of imagination, scholarly precision, and literary skill with which he's recovered and illuminated the beliefs of ordinary people in early modern Europe. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contribution to his school historical scholarship, I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Letters on orders Kauser, on Professor Carlo Ginzburg. Take in Gradu Doctoris litteram on oris causa preview. Curious Ray in Symbolum superette hope britam imponent. This is a great honor indeed. I am deeply moved. And deeply grateful. To the University of Saint Andrews, the vice chancellor. To all those who made this. Recognition to my work possible. And. I'm. Grateful to Bridget for a generous words. Yeah, she's right in emphasizing the fact that I worked across disciplines. Actually it would, which I dislike. And I used to say that history as a. Cognitive approach should not be regarded as a fortress closed in itself, but as an airport from which you may leave. In different directions. But it's also true. That retrospectively. I can find a common element in my trajectory. My first essay, which I published a long time ago. Ended with a centre saying more or less, not it was a based on a witchcraft trial which took place in Moderna northern Italy, against a peasant woman Kiara Signorini, who had been ejected by landlady because she said that kerosene was a witch, and they had put a charm against her. So at the end of my work on that trial, I said notwithstanding the specificity of this trial, I think that. It has a paradigmatic value. So years ago I read again that that essay in that sentence, and I thought, well, keys. It's a case which has a paradigmatic value and then paradigmatic. And I thought, well, obviously, this was an echo of Thomas Koons destructure of scientific revolution. But I was wrong. Actually, my essay was published one year before Thomas Koons work, so paradigmatic meant exemplary, and I think that I've been working on anomalous exemplary cases until today. Thank you very much. I call upon Doctor Simon Prosser of the School of Philosophical, Anthropological, and Film Studies. Vice chancellor colleagues, graduates and special guests. Congratulations to all our new graduates. We are all delighted for you and you should feel very proud of what you have achieved during your time with us. This is of course, an unusual graduation ceremony. Since most of you graduating finished your studies a year ago I do hope things have gone very well during the last year and we are delighted that you were able to come back to Saint Andrews to see us again and to join us in celebrating your achievements. There is no doubt that you finished your degree during an extraordinary period of history. As much for this institution as elsewhere. I hope that when you look back in the years to come. That last rather difficult part of your time with us doesn't dominate your memories. At the Newstead, you'll still have vivid memories of making new friends from all around the world. And have phone fights in the quad. And of that feeling of satisfaction when that piece of laboratory apparatus that you've been struggling with finally produced a graph that was the right shape. And of conversations about politics and philosophy on long walks on the West sands. And not just memories of suddenly realising that you'd forgotten to blur the background while attending a class on Microsoft Teams from a rather messy bedroom or of your lecturer doing the same. Well, this is the first time I've been asked to give a graduation address, and I must admit that my immediate reaction was to feel honoured, but also slightly terrified. But you know the opportunities that seem scary to us are very often the ones that we ought to accept, because very often those are the ones that will help us to grow. There are so many ways in which people can grow. During your time here, we have watched you grow in many of these ways. We grow when we gain knowledge, and you've certainly done that. But we also grow in other ways. When we broaden our experiences and confront new challenges. We become stronger and more confident in ourselves, steadier on our feet, better able to tackle what life throws at us. It is an amazing thing for those of us who teach here. To watch the transformation in students as they pass from. Their arrival is fresh as often just out of school, sometimes awkwardly inarticulate. To become the capable and impressive young adults that we see just four or five years later at graduation. That transformation is not to be underestimated. You leave as a quite different person to the one who arrived. But we should never stop growing. Human beings, like many other living things, need to grow in order to flourish. You should never let your life stagnate by just doing what you know and taking the safe options. To grow, we must embrace change, accept new challenges. Challenges that will stretch us to our limits, but make us better for it. In your lives, individually and collectively, you may face many challenges, some of them never faced by previous generations. But in many ways you are better equipped than any previous generation to meet those challenges. The knowledge and the intellectual training that you have acquired will stand you in good stead. Have trust in yourself. Embrace the changes and never stop growing. But today's not about all that today is about you and what you've achieved during your time at this university. I really hope you enjoy celebrating your achievements, and I wish you all the very best for the future wherever your journey may take you. Stay in touch. We're always happy to hear your news and always remember that we are immensely proud of you. Please stand for the benediction. Grazia Domini Nostri Jesu Christi, at Caritas de, at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum, omnibus nobis in secular siculum, Amen."
