duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can share this with us this historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger wall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate 's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors also it's not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews has been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual development since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect but so too do we cherish our history which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history but creates it students of fifteenth century saint andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic metaphysics and ethics all inspired by aristotle speaking in the vernacular was forbidden and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in latin which remained our official institutional language until seventeen forty seven examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by once professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at fifteenth century saint andrews as too distracting but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in fourteen seventy when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows student life in saint leonards college over a century after our foundation in fifteen forty four evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at five AM attended mass at six started at class at seven with a lesson selected by the principal and continued to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over fifty years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in seventeen forty two james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from seventeen fifty seven to seventeen sixty one and two eminent eighteenth century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marott in seventeen seventy five and in seventeen ninety two edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the eighteen hundreds saint andrews had become as described by one contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of eighteen fifty eight introduced the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in eighteen ninety two and by the nineteen hundreds students life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september nineteen eleven which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate three thousand five hundred gathered guests garden parties spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of a hundred and forty five universities and learned societies visited and one hundred honorary degrees were bestowed a student board took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided one hundred thousand pounds for its construction around six million pounds in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june nineteen twenty nine its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honor of the nineteen eleven celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors it is therefore sight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before then returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since salvatore's chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognizes that the class of twenty twenty one was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july twenty twenty one and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at super tay 's meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire in his hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour the lord sedwill to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor graham turnbull from the school of physics and astronomy the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and to support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a center andrean throughout your life decanus faculty artis artsiom vice chancellor i ask you to confirm the degree of master of arts with honours on

mortared and had someone come after me with a suicide vest was how lord said i said well responded to a question about how he handles what he refers to as the political sniping which is a regrettable feature of modern governance i simply remind myself he says that it really isn't as bad as the real thing and so summarizes in his own words what has been an extraordinary career mark said well was born in ealing where he attended born in grammar school and was head boy a sign of things to come he then earned a bachelor of science in economics from the university of saint andrews in nineteen eighty seven and a master of philosophy and economics from saint edmund hall university of oxford in nineteen eighty nine the UK 's first and second ranked universities respectively following university mark joined the foreign and commonwealth commonwealth office where he held an expansive and impressive array of positions indeed far too many to name in just a few minutes but to give you just the flavor he held a multitude of rules between nineteen eighty nine and twenty thirteen having begun his career as the second secretary in the security and coordination department quickly followed by second secretary in cairo between nineteen ninety one and nineteen ninety four his public service then included but is by no means limited to the first secretary in iraq and united nations weapons inspector from nineteen ninety six to nineteen ninety seven private secretary to foreign secretaries robin cook and jack straw between two thousand and two thousand and three director of UK visas and the home office between two thousand and six and two thousand and eight ambassador to afghanistan from two thousand and nine to twenty ten where in a demonstration of their esteem for him the entire afghani cabinet turned out to his farewell ceremony and the defense minister as a parting gift returned an old lee enfield rifle that he claimed was acquired during an earlier visit by the british to the region and finally UK special representative for afghanistan and pakistan between twenty eleven and twenty thirteen from whitehall to egypt and then iraq from the UN to cyprus from pakistan to the mina department from afghanistan to a representative of nato lord sedwill has exemplified the university 's motto ever to excel in twenty thirteen mark was appointed permanent secretary in the home office a role he held until twenty seventeen and then in twenty seventeen he was appointed first as national security adviser a job he was eminently well qualified for and then to his surprise although not to many of those who knew and have worked with him i suspect as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service until his resignation in twenty twenty here he led over four hundred thousand UK civil servants and HM government and the devolved administrations were in his own words he advised the prime minister and cabinet on the country 's international and domestic security economic and social policies and coordinating the development and deployment of the UK 's national capabilities to deliver them and he was known for his calm and shrewd advice and unflappable good humor skillfully navigating one of the most unstable and tumultuous political periods in recent history including a change of premiership and election brexit and of course covid where he was touted as in very difficult circumstances being instrumental in drafting a plan to suppress the virus indeed his distinguished service has been recognized for her majesty the queen in the twenty eighteen new year's honours list with a knighthood and in twenty twenty he was made barron said will of sherborne in the county of dorset he also holds a wide range of fellowships from the institute of directors to the royal geographical society and has been the recipient of numerous other awards and honors for his national and international public service mark is widely respected across the political spectrum as he demitted office the prime minister said after serving for decades with great distinction he believes that lord said well has earned the gratitude of the nation and labour 's shadow cabinet office minister at the time helen hayes said we pay tribute to the work mark said well has done and so do we manifest the nation 's gratitude in an honorary degree from his alma mater

family well thank you let me start by offering my own congratulations to professor dame sally matson the principal and vice chancellor who was appointed a dame commander in the platinum jubilee honours list a great recognition of her outstanding leadership of britain 's top university well you've heard all the letters i have after my name now and thank you very much for the extraordinary honour of adding to that list but of course the last time i was in this chamber was almost exactly thirty five years ago and i was sitting there and i had the first honorarium when i was given my bachelor of science degree all the rest came later and that remarkable set of opportunities that i have had since i was the first member of my family to go to university i've been at the village primary school and the local state grammar school and the town just like all of you i had i worked hard enough to get my degree over the four years i was here i had all the ups and downs of student life made all the same mistakes that most of you will have made i played quite a lot of golf and quite a bit of football both of which have been recently legalised by the time i got here and attended some absolutely extraordinary beach parties down on the on the west sounds but most of all what i learned here and i hope the the other graduates today appreciate this too is the this small town perched on the peninsula of five and the university here brings together an extraordinary diversity of talent both in the student body and in the academic body and that opened my eyes to the world and set me off on the journey that you heard about earlier and this has brought me back here today and so i hope it does the same for you i hope you all have as much luck as i've had since leaving this university and thank you for letting me share your special day i call upon professor graham turnbull of the school of physics and astronomy vice chancellor 's honored honored guests colleagues it's my great honour today to address our new graduates this afternoon congratulations to you all we applaud your success and the remarkable achievements of your hard work today at last is your day of celebration your families and your friends are rightly proud of you and we're all delighted to celebrate your success normally graduation marks the end of one important phase of your life and the beginning of a new adventure not so for the class of twenty twenty one you have already launched a thousand new adventures graduation for you marks a brief reencounter with your alma mater a short flypast on a journey that you launched a year ago like a spacecraft swinging past the old familiar planet to propel you onwards to new worlds this gravitational slingshot is a remarkable process in which two bodies interact while they're physically distanced and through the pandemic we have all learned how to do that we the moving planet have transferred a small part of our momentum to you the the spacecraft this can send you in a new direction it can increase your speed by twice the speed of the planet the slingshot was a visionary concept for space travel from a brilliant young ukrainian engineer named yuri kondratyuk yuri was born in eighteen ninety seven in poltava a city one hundred kilometres west of harkov he was actually born with a different name alexander ignatovich sharkey but he lived through turbulent times that would change his life his name and his career a target of the bolshevik army for being on the wrong side of the revolution the young alexander tried to flee to poland but when this failed he was forced instead to take the name and identity of another man yuri kondratyuk who had recently died of TB and then he fled east to start his new life throughout his life he was fascinated by the distant possibility of space travel and he conceived remarkable engineering solutions that would one day make this possible one hundred years ago when planes were still largely made of cloth and wood he conceived how to land a human being on the moon and bring them back a multi stage rocket could propel a small spacecraft into the orbit of the moon from which an even smaller spacecraft would hop down to the surface and back again his incredible foresight and calculations in the nineteen twenties became the technical solutions of the space age that would take astronauts to the moon and back and spacecraft to the far reaches of our solar system unable to advance his work on space travel yuri applied his skills instead to more earthly matters designing a massive grain elevator in siberia and a huge wind turbine for crimea that was eighty years ahead of its time tragically yuri never saw any of his grandest projects completed politics suspicion and even the gulag intervened yuri died in action in the second world war and so did not witness the space age that would verify and implement his visit his visionary calculations so what advice can i draw from the life of this brilliant ukrainian engineer now i cannot recommend that you begin your career with a name change and identity theft however you must be determined in the face of adversity the world as we all can plainly see often moves in a direction that neither makes sense nor will slingshot you forward my most important advice though in whatever you choose to do in your life is that you must reach for the moon dream big but don't just dream do the maths and work out how you might bring these dreams to reality your santandrea 's degree is an educational slingshot that will propel you forwards on your life journey i wish you a successful journey and hope that many of you will choose a trajectory that will bring you back again to saint andrews at some point in the future thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sid kumam nebus nobis in secular siculum ahmed i think problems as well thank you well",

professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century st andrews as too distracting but archery an important skill for the defence of the realm was promoted this may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470 when after an unresolved argument the dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows student life in st leonards college over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university founded within a religious capital students were awoken at 5:00 AM attended mass at six started at class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continued to learn until well into the evenings football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions women were also strictly forbidden lest they like football should prove too distracting with the exception of a single laundress and on the condition that she was over 50 years old the severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time adam ferguson a renowned enlightenment philosopher graduated in 1742 james wilson a founding father of the united states studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD or doctor of medicine by the university the french revolutionary jean paul marott in 1775 and in 1792 edward jenner whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox pioneered modern immunology by the beginning of the 1800s saint andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus a healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits governmental reform by way of the university scotland act of 1858 introduced the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day women were admitted to full-time study in 1892 and by the 1900s students life resembled many of our current graduates experiences perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of september 1911 which resemble our activities today planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties spread across the town speeches were delivered representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed a student board took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the bell pettigrew museum and the town came to life with song and celebration the younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations it was built with a lead donation by doctor james and mrs annie younger members of the local saint andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms and it was opened by queen elizabeth the queen mother in june 1929 its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honor of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors it is therefore sight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour by leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better as so many have done before then returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since salvatore's chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and i am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognizes that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july 2021 and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelors masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirmed the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say at super tay's meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december 1696 when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the confirmations are complete since our veterans chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire in his hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion we will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies the presentation of honorary awards with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour the lord sedwill to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor graham turnbull from the school of physics and astronomy the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years and to support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a center

UK's first and second ranked universities respectively following university mark joined the foreign and commonwealth commonwealth office where he held an expansive and impressive array of positions indeed far too many to name in just a few minutes but to give you just the flavor he held a multitude of rules between 1989 and 2013 having begun his career as the second secretary in the security and coordination department quickly followed by second secretary in cairo between 1991 and 1994 his public service then included but is by no means limited to the first secretary in iraq and united nations weapons inspector from 1996 to 1997 private secretary to foreign secretaries robin cook and jack straw between 2000 and 2003 director of UK visas and the home office between 2006 and 2008

returned an old lee enfield rifle that he claimed was acquired during an earlier visit by the british to the region and finally UK special representative for afghanistan and pakistan between 2011 and 2013 from whitehall to egypt and then iraq from the UN to cyprus from pakistan to the mina department from afghanistan to a representative of nato lord sedwill has exemplified the university's motto ever to excel in 2013 mark was appointed permanent secretary in the home office a role he held until 2017 and then in 2017 he was appointed first as national security adviser a job he was eminently well qualified for and then to his surprise although not to many of those who knew and have worked with him i suspect as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service until his resignation in 2020 here he led over 4 100,000 UK civil servants and HM government and the devolved administrations were in his own words he advised the prime minister and cabinet on the country's international and domestic security economic and social policies and coordinating the development and deployment of the UK's national capabilities to deliver them and he was known for his calm and shrewd advice and unflappable good humor skillfully navigating one of the most unstable and tumultuous political periods in recent history including a change of premiership and election brexit and of course covid where he was touted as in very difficult circumstances being instrumental in drafting a plan to suppress the virus indeed his distinguished service has been recognized for her majesty the queen in the 2018 new year's honours list with a knighthood and in 2020 he was made barron said will of sherborne in the county of dorset he also holds a wide range of fellowships from the institute of directors to the

list but of course the last time i was in this chamber was almost exactly 35 years ago and i was sitting there and i had the first honorarium when i was given my bachelor of science degree all the rest came later and that remarkable set of opportunities that i have had since i was the first member of my family to go to university i've been at the village primary school and the local state grammar school and the town just like all of you i had i worked hard enough to get my degree over the four years i was here i had all the ups and downs of student life made all the same mistakes that most of you will have made i played quite a lot of golf and quite a bit of football both of which have been recently legalised by the time i got here and attended some absolutely extraordinary beach parties down on the on the west sounds but most of all what i learned here and i hope the the other graduates today appreciate this too is the this small town perched on the peninsula of five and the university here brings together an extraordinary diversity of talent both in the student body and in the academic body and that opened my eyes to the world and set me off on the journey that you heard about earlier and this has brought me back here today and so i hope it does the same for you i hope you all have as much luck as i've had since leaving this university and thank you for letting me share your special day i call upon professor graham turnbull of the school of physics and astronomy vice chancellor's honored honored guests colleagues it's my great honour today to address our new graduates this afternoon congratulations to you all we applaud your success and the remarkable achievements of your hard work today at last is your day of celebration your families and your friends are rightly proud of you and we're all delighted to celebrate your success normally graduation marks the end of 1 important phase of your life and the beginning of a new adventure not so for the class of 2021 you have already launched 1000 new adventures graduation for you marks a brief reencounter with your alma mater a short flypast on a journey that you launched a year ago like a spacecraft swinging past the old familiar planet to propel you onwards to new worlds this gravitational slingshot is a remarkable process in which two bodies interact while they're physically distanced and through the pandemic we have all learned how to do that we the moving planet have transferred a small part of our momentum to you the the spacecraft this can send you in a new direction it can increase your speed by twice the speed of the planet the slingshot was a visionary concept for space travel from a brilliant young ukrainian engineer named yuri kondratyuk yuri was born in 1897 in poltava a city 100 kilometres west of harkov he was actually born with a different name alexander ignatovich sharkey but he lived through turbulent times that would change his life his name and his career a target of the bolshevik army for being on the wrong side of the revolution the young alexander tried to flee to poland but when this failed he was forced instead to take the name and identity of another man yuri kondratyuk who had recently died of TB and then he fled east to start his new life throughout his life he was fascinated by the distant possibility of space travel and he conceived remarkable engineering solutions that would one day make this possible 100 years ago when planes were still largely made of cloth and wood he conceived how to land a human being on the moon and bring them back a multi stage rocket could propel a small spacecraft into the orbit of the moon from which an even smaller spacecraft would hop down to the surface and back again his incredible foresight and calculations in the 1920s became the technical solutions of the space age that would take astronauts to the moon and back and spacecraft to the far reaches of our solar system unable to advance his work on space travel yuri applied his skills instead to more earthly matters designing a massive grain elevator in siberia and a huge wind turbine for crimea that was 80 years ahead of its time tragically yuri never saw any of his grandest projects completed politics suspicion and even the gulag intervened yuri died in action in the second world war and so did not witness the space age that would verify and implement his visit his visionary calculations so what advice can i draw from the life of this brilliant ukrainian engineer now i cannot recommend that you begin your career with a name change and identity theft however you must be determined in the face of adversity the world as we all can plainly see often moves in a direction that neither makes sense nor will slingshot you forward my most important advice though in whatever you choose to do in your life is that you must reach for the moon dream big but don't just dream do the maths and work out how you might bring these dreams to reality your santandrea's degree is an educational slingshot that will propel you forwards on your life journey i wish you a successful journey and hope that many of you will choose a trajectory that will bring you back again to saint andrews at some point in the future thank you please stand for the benediction gracia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sid kumam nebus nobis in secular siculum ahmed i think problems as well thank you well",

Restroom ohmed please be seated. Good afternoon everyone. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions, and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can share this with us. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of imperson summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic. It is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers and loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929. The younger wall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduate's place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Also, it's not, however, a story of survival, but of leadership. Saint Andrews has been at the vanguard of political, cultural and intellectual development since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. Universities are by their nature institutions of forward progress, and we keep an eye perennially to the future so that our research and graduates serve the world with maximum effect. But so too do we cherish our history, which chronicles how similar our activities are in many respects to the time of our foundation, but also the ways in which our teaching and activities have adapted to ensure that our university is not subservient to history, but creates it. Students of 15th century St. Andrews learned primarily through lengthy orations delivered by their masters and instructors, often in the teachers private residence as part of a curriculum focused on logic, metaphysics and ethics. All inspired by Aristotle. Speaking in the vernacular was forbidden, and teaching and conversation alike were conducted in Latin, which remained our official institutional language until 1747. Examinations took the form of a verbal interrogation by once professors and discourse could become so heated that students were known on occasion to descend into violence. Football and astonishingly golf were both banned at 15th century St. Andrews as too distracting. But archery an important skill for the defence of the realm, was promoted. This may have occasioned second thoughts in 1470, when, after an unresolved argument, the Dean and members of the faculty were set upon by students with those and arrows. Student life in St. Leonards College. Over a century after our foundation in 1544 evidenced more of the asceticism of the university. Founded within a religious capital. Students were awoken at 5:00 AM. Attended mass at six. Started at class at 7 with a lesson selected by the principal and continued to learn until well into the evenings. Football was still banned as now where it will surprise no one. Weapons and the college strictly prohibited beards and certain groovy fashions. Women were also strictly forbidden, lest they, like football, should prove too distracting, with the exception of a single laundress. And on the condition that she was over 50 years old. The severity of student life lessened in the two centuries that followed, and an increasingly modernised curriculum was enjoyed by some of the foremost luminaries of the time. Adam Ferguson, a renowned Enlightenment philosopher, graduated in 1742. James Wilson, a founding father of the United States, studied here from 1757 to 1761 and two eminent 18th century figures were awarded the degree of MD. Or Doctor of medicine by the university. The French revolutionary Jean Paul Marott in 1775, and in 1792 Edward Jenner, whose advancements in the prevention of smallpox, pioneered modern immunology. By the beginning of the 1800s, Saint Andrews had become as described by 1 contemporary alumnus. A healthy retired spot in which one can learn virtuous and economical habits. Governmental reform by way of the University Scotland Act of 1858 introduced the organizational structures which remain mostly intact to this day, women were admitted to full-time study in 1892, and by the 1900s students life resembled many of our current graduates experiences. Perhaps the greatest evocation of this is in the universities quincentenary celebrations of September 1911, which resemble our activities today. Planning for the anniversary took three years and required the erection of a temporary venue to accommodate 3500 gathered guests garden parties spread across the town. Speeches were delivered representatives of 145 universities and learned societies visited and 100 honorary degrees were bestowed. A student board took place as well as a formal banquet for staff and guests in the Bell Pettigrew Museum, and the town came to life with song and celebration. The younger hall was a happy outcome of these celebrations. It was built with a lead donation by Doctor James and Mrs Annie Younger, members of the local Saint Andrews community who provided £100,000 for its construction around £6 million in current terms, and it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in June 1929. Its construction was however also supported by funds raised on an early subscription model in honor of the 1911 celebrations and by which means contemporary alumni laid the foundation of the building that would be enjoyed by so many of their successors. It is therefore sight to which the splendor of our current surroundings is owed and which our graduates will honour. By leaving this hall and using their education to change the world for the better, as so many have done. Before then. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since Salvatore's Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor. Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and I am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognizes that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation, and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that paucity of quintessential festivities one year later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in June or July 2021, and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred, with the exception of our honorary graduate who will be recognised for the first time. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I will use to confirm the degrees, will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at bachelors, Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties, and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirmed the degree of Master of Arts, and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP. To most though, I will simply say at Super Tay's meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the confirmations are complete, since our veterans Chapel choir will return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director Claire in his Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. We will then proceed directly to a highlight of these ceremonies. The presentation of honorary awards, with the conferral of an honorary doctorate upon today's guest of honour. The Lord sedwill. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Professor Graham Turnbull from the School of Physics and Astronomy. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments. But this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews. And you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years. And to support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step in your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a center andrean throughout your life. Decanus faculty Artis artsiom.

Vice Chancellor, it is my privilege to present for the degree of Doctor of Laws. Aneiros causa the Lord Sedwill. I've had a gun in my face, a bomb under my seat. I've been hosted by a man plotting to have me assassinated. I've been shot at mortared and had someone come after me with a suicide vest. Was how Lord said. I said, well responded to a question about how he handles what he refers to as the political sniping, which is a regrettable feature of modern governance. I simply remind myself he says, that it really isn't as bad as the real thing. And so summarizes in his own words what has been an extraordinary career Mark said, well was born in Ealing, where he attended, born in grammar school and was head boy, a sign of things to come. He then earned a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the University of Saint Andrews in 1987, and a Master of Philosophy and Economics from Saint Edmund Hall, University of Oxford. In 1989, the UK's first and second ranked universities, respectively. Following university Mark joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Commonwealth Office where he held an expansive and impressive array of positions. Indeed, far too many to name in just a few minutes. But to give you just the flavor, he held a multitude of rules between 1989 and 2013, having begun his career as the Second secretary in the security and Coordination Department, quickly followed by Second Secretary in Cairo between 1991 and 1994. His public service then included, but is by no means limited to the First Secretary in Iraq and United Nations weapons inspector from 1996. To 1997, private secretary to foreign secretaries Robin Cook and Jack Straw, between 2000 and 2003, director of UK visas and the Home Office between 2006 and 2008, Ambassador to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, where, in a demonstration of their esteem for him, the entire Afghani cabinet turned out to his farewell ceremony and the defense minister as a parting gift returned. An old Lee Enfield rifle that he claimed was acquired during an earlier visit by the British to the region. And finally UK Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan between 2011 and 2013. From Whitehall to Egypt and then Iraq from the UN to Cyprus, from Pakistan to the Mina department, from Afghanistan to a representative of NATO, Lord Sedwill has exemplified the university's motto ever to excel. In 2013, Mark was appointed Permanent Secretary in the Home Office, a role he held until 2017, and then in 2017 he was appointed first as national Security Adviser, a job he was eminently well qualified for and then to his surprise, although not to many of those who knew and have worked with him, I suspect as Cabinet secretary and head of the Civil service until his resignation in 2020. Here he led over 4. 100,000 UK civil servants and HM Government and the devolved administrations were in his own words. He advised the Prime Minister and cabinet on the country's international and domestic security, economic and social policies and coordinating the development and deployment of the UK's national capabilities to deliver them. And he was known for his calm and shrewd advice and unflappable good humor skillfully navigating. One of the most unstable and tumultuous political periods in recent history, including a change of premiership and election Brexit and of course COVID, where he was touted as in very difficult circumstances. Being instrumental in drafting a plan to suppress the virus. Indeed, his distinguished service has been recognized for Her Majesty the Queen in the 2018 New Year's Honours list with a knighthood, and in 2020 he was made. Barron said will of Sherborne in the county of Dorset. He also holds a wide range of fellowships from the Institute of Directors to the Royal Geographical Society and has been the recipient of numerous other awards and honors for his national and International public service. Mark is widely respected across the political spectrum as he demitted office, the Prime Minister said after serving for decades with great distinction, he believes that Lord said, well has earned the gratitude of the nation. And Labour's shadow Cabinet Office Minister at the time Helen Hayes said we pay tribute to the work Mark said well has done and so do we manifest the nation's gratitude in an honorary degree from his alma mater. Vice Chancellor, in recognition of his major contributions to diplomacy, national security and UK policy making. I invite you to confer the degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, on Mark Sedwell. Tay in Gradu Doctoris legum on Oris kalser promove you Kuya spray and symbolum superette Hoke berekum impola. Many congratulations. Vice Chancellor, Professor McKay, a colleagues, graduates and and friends and family. Well. Thank you. Let me start by offering my own congratulations to Professor Dame Sally Matson, the principal and Vice Chancellor who was appointed a Dame commander in the Platinum Jubilee Honours list. A great recognition of her outstanding leadership of Britain's top university. Well, you've heard all the letters I have after my name now and thank you very much for the extraordinary honour of adding to that list. But of course, the last time I was in this Chamber was almost exactly 35 years ago. And I was sitting there and I had the first honorarium when I was given my Bachelor of Science degree. All the rest came later. And that remarkable set of opportunities that I have had since I was the first member of my family to go to university. I've been at the village primary school and the local state grammar school and the town, just like all of you I had. I worked hard enough to get my degree over the four years I was here. I had all the ups and downs of student life, made all the same mistakes that most of you will have made. I played quite a lot of golf and quite a bit of football. Both of which have been recently legalised by the time I got here. And attended some absolutely extraordinary beach parties down on the on the West sounds, but most of all what I learned here and I hope the the other graduates today appreciate this too. Is the this small town perched on the peninsula of five and the university here brings together an extraordinary diversity of talent both in the student body and. In the academic body and that opened my eyes to the world and set me off on the journey that you heard about earlier. And this has brought me back here today and so I hope it does the same for you. I hope you all have as much luck as I've had since leaving this university and thank you for letting me share your special day. I call upon Professor Graham Turnbull of the School of Physics and Astronomy. Vice Chancellor's honored honored guests colleagues. It's my great honour today to address our new graduates this afternoon. Congratulations to you all. We applaud your success and the remarkable achievements of your hard work. Today at last is your day of celebration. Your families and your friends are rightly proud of you, and we're all delighted to celebrate your success. Normally graduation marks the end of 1 important phase of your life. And the beginning of a new adventure. Not so for the class of 2021. You have already launched 1000 new adventures. Graduation for you marks a brief reencounter with your alma mater. A short flypast on a journey that you launched a year ago. Like a spacecraft swinging past the old familiar planet to propel you onwards to new worlds. This gravitational slingshot is a remarkable process in which two bodies interact while they're physically distanced. And through the pandemic we have all learned how to do that. We, the moving planet, have transferred a small part of our momentum to you, the the spacecraft. This can send you in a new direction. It can increase your speed by twice the speed of the planet. The slingshot was a visionary concept for space travel from a brilliant young Ukrainian engineer named Yuri Kondratyuk. Yuri was born in 1897 in Poltava, a city 100 kilometres West of Harkov. He was actually born with a different name. Alexander Ignatovich Sharkey. But he lived through turbulent times that would change his life, his name and his career. A target of the Bolshevik army for being on the wrong side of the revolution. The young Alexander tried to flee to Poland. But when this failed, he was forced instead to take the name and identity of another man, Yuri Kondratyuk, who had recently died of TB. And then he fled east to start his new life. Throughout his life he was fascinated by the distant possibility of space travel, and he conceived remarkable engineering solutions that would one day make this possible. 100 years ago, when planes were still largely made of cloth and wood, he conceived how to land a human being on the moon and bring them back. A multi stage rocket could propel a small spacecraft into the orbit of the moon. From which an even smaller spacecraft would hop down to the surface and back again. His incredible foresight and calculations in the 1920s. Became the technical solutions of the space age. That would take astronauts to the moon and back. And spacecraft to the far reaches of our solar system. Unable to advance his work on space Travel, Yuri applied his skills instead to more earthly matters. Designing a massive grain elevator in Siberia. And a huge wind turbine for Crimea that was 80 years ahead of its time. Tragically, Yuri never saw any of his grandest projects completed. Politics, suspicion and even the gulag intervened. Yuri died in action in the Second World War, and so did not witness the space age that would verify and implement his visit his visionary calculations. So what advice can I draw from the life of this brilliant Ukrainian engineer? Now I cannot recommend that you begin your career with a name change and identity theft. However, you must be determined in the face of adversity. The world, as we all can plainly see, often moves in a direction that neither makes sense nor will slingshot you forward. My most important advice though, in whatever you choose to do in your life, is that you must reach for the moon. Dream big. But don't just dream do the maths and work out how you might bring these dreams to reality. Your santandrea's degree is an educational slingshot that will propel you forwards on your life journey. I wish you a successful journey. And hope that many of you will choose a trajectory that will bring you back again to Saint Andrews at some point in the future. Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Gracia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti. Sid Kumam nebus nobis in secular Siculum Ahmed. I think. Problems as well. Thank you. Well."
