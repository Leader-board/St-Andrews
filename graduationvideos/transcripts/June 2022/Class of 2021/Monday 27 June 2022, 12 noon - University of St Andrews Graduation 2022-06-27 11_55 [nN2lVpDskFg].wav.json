good afternoon everyone it is my happy duty as principal and vice chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the university of saint andrews graduation is the highlight of our academic year at these ceremonies students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured we orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission i am delighted that all of you can join us for this this historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year period in which they were hosted online due to the pandemic it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that i can welcome and address you directly and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends peers teachers and loved ones in the usual way this ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall the home of our graduation ceremonies since it opened in nineteen twenty nine the younger hall closed in july twenty nineteen for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users the buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century crossed it before them the broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at saint andrews since the second decade of the fifteenth century when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the fourteen hundreds remain an integral part of the ceremony these rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduates place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world we are scotland 's first and foremost university the third oldest in the english speaking world and one of the twenty five oldest still operating across six hundred and nine years students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them the religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors ours is not however a story of survival but of leadership saint andrews 's been at the vanguard of political cultural and intellectual developments since our inception and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days the importance of our town predates the university 's foundation saint andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval scotland the twelfth century cathedral the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time a centre for pilgrimage home to scotland 's senior bishop and consecrated upon completion in the presence of robert the bruce in thirteen eighteen university instruction commenced here in may fourteen ten when our founder bishop henry wardlaw invited a delegation of scholars led by lawrence of lindores a philosopher of renown to the town and university status was formalised when pope benedict the thirteenth issued papal bulls from peniscola in august fourteen thirteen which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following february the royal leaders of scotland and later of the united kingdom have been a guiding enriching and at times challenging presence in our history saint andrews was the spiritual home of scotland and on occasion hosted the scottish court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the royal household our founder bishop henry wardlaw served as an adviser and diplomat to king robert the third and later as tutor and protector to his son the future king james the first of scotland who resided with him in saint andrews castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to france which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in england for eighteen years king james revisited saint andrews throughout his life celebrating christmas here in fourteen twenty five and he was so enamoured by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to perth his request was dutifully and happily ignored our university library the oldest continuous library in scotland is indebted to royal patronage king james the sixth of scotland and first of england visited saint andrews in sixteen seventeen and made a gift of two hundred volumes to the university library a building in his honour to accommodate this collection the king james library was completed in sixteen forty three on south street this was a key moment for the early library but one suspects that king james was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign king james clashed repeatedly with andrew melville a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as principal of saint mary's college from fifteen eighty and as rector from fifteen ninety melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university but was resistant to royal interference given the choice of putting up with an obstructive university administrator or removing the obstacle altogether king james locked melville in the tower of london royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life throughout its existence we enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating her majesty the queen 's platinum jubilee celebrations we have been honoured by the presence of her majesty periodically throughout her reign most recently at the graduation of our alumni their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge at a graduation ceremony very like this one in two thousand and five we were delighted to welcome their royal highnesses back to the university for a visit in may twenty twenty one and earlier this month we unveiled a fortieth birthday portrait of the duchess of cambridge at the university 's wardlaw museum our recently redeveloped museum situated on the schools which is well worth a visit in crossing today's stage each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps but also in the footsteps of the academics leaders and changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of fife to shape the world in profound ways the journey you make from here is yours to envisage but their example is one from which we can all draw inspiration returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears the first of these you have already witnessed as since our veterans chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the gaudeamus and the university chaplain the reverend doctor donald mcewen delivered the opening prayer as vice chancellor i preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction this ceremony recognises that the class of twenty twenty one was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that poor city of quintessential festivities one year later we also recognise in the process that the members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in june or july twenty twenty one and thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred this graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way although the latin which i will use to confirm the degrees will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice the presentation of these awards at bachelor 's masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony i will call upon the deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties and i will then confirm the degree with latin phrases one of which for example translates as i confirm the degree of master of arts and to symbolise this i place upon you this cap to most though i will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too the precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates cap or berekum touches the head of the graduate this academic cap has been used in every ceremony since december sixteen ninety six when it was acquired from a saint andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community when the conferrals are complete i shall then make a special presentation of the principal 's medal and award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to one of our graduates the principles medal for the academic year twenty twenty to twenty twenty one will today be bestowed upon zainab majzoub who received a joint degree from the schools of modern languages and international relations since our theaters chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director claire innes hopkins for the felicity they bring to this occasion to close our ceremony it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation today's guest speaker is professor john hudson from the school of history the ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession at saint andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with saint andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for six hundred and nine years and to support one another in the present so you are not leaving our community but taking the next step in your saint andrews experience and it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a saint andrean throughout your life dequina 's faculty artists arts hilton vice chancellor i ask

medal this award was inaugurated thirteen years ago with a gift from three anonymous donors and is supported by ed and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and road makers in the world the award of the principles medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards were open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year twenty twenty to twenty twenty one the principal 's medal was awarded to three outstanding students and this celebration enables us to bestow the medal in the customary way today we recognise zaynap majzoub who graduated with a master of arts with honours in arabic spanish and international relations and i am pleased to note that zaynab received a very strong first class degree zeynab applied to join the university of saint andrews through our supported pathway program which is designed to unblock potential where it had previously not been allowed to flourish senap impressed the interview panel so much that she was accepted directly into the school of international relations rather than onto the supported pathway and she was utterly triumphant in her academic endeavours from the gecko consistently ranking at the top of her class whilst doing so zenab served as an exemplary colleague to her peers including by volunteering as a mentor to incoming students on widening access programmes for over two years outwith the university zaynab committed substantial portions of her time to supporting people from disadvantaged backgrounds seen up work with the scottish refugee council as a children and families support worker and she spent time around her studies teaching english to refugees and asylum seekers in the UK zenab has also advocated to raise awareness of human rights crises as a humanitarian school speaker for the red cross and she supported young people as an ambassador for the prince 's trust for which she was a finalist for the young ambassador of the year award in twenty eighteen these are just a few of the organisations with which saynab has worked which range further from queen margaret university to waverley care and on subjects from decona colonising educational curricula to awareness raising about the prevalence of female genital mutilation in all of these activities they now demonstrated a deep rooted commitment to supporting others and to wielding her education for the good of the people around her and the society of which she is apart that is an exemplary way to use ones saint andrews education and i'm delighted to recognise that zaynab is pursuing further study at king kings college london where she is reading for the degree of master of science in global health zeynab in recognition of all that you achieved academically and your selfless support of others during your time as an undergraduate it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principles madam comma i call bishop wardlaw professor john hudson of the school of history vice chancellor on the guests colleagues graduates of the university it's a pleasure to be here to congratulate a group of former students this way there's a peculiar graduation it's peculiar in that you come from almost every school in the university instead of the only one or two that is customary and i'll try and mention all of you it's peculiar also in that the majority of you departed from saint andrews a year ago rather than the customary weeks ago i like both of these aspects the mixing of students of different disciplines which characterized your first years in halls five or even more years ago and this being your first reunion the first i hope of many and it's peculiar in that you all have been doing things other than undergraduate degrees for the last year and indeed have graduated once already gone are my chances recycling graduation address platitudes wishing you well as you enter the real world i wonder even what the correct term for you and for this ceremony is the social anthropologists amongst you will know that liminality threshold crossing is often central to rituals but in today's ritual you are all stopping stepping across the threshold from being a graduate to being a graduate let's then reflect further on the words involved classicists amongst you know that the word graduate derives from the latin grados meaning step the same word gives us the modern word grade those marks which while you were receiving them but probably no longer meant a great deal to you these grades determined the classification of your degree in such classification etymology meets mathematics and computing because modern linguists amongst you may know that the word degree likewise derives from grados as martin turned into french the deed disappeared from gradas and gave us grey or green and hence degree those of you who took english may have read charlotte bronte 's villette where character hurdles up a staircase three degrees at a time degrees still in the mid nineteenth century being able to mean step and then what may reflect that degrade is exactly the same word as degree and those of you from biology chemistry earth and environmental sciences geography and sustainable development maybe in management too will know that degrade is one of those words that are shifted from being a negative to sometimes being a positive moral philosophers even ordinary language analytical philosophers might take an interest in how a preference for the non degradable might now be seen as degrading and the oddities continue some of you will be continuing in medicine and know that third degree burns are the most serious others may be at law school and know that third degree homicide is the least serious some of you now will be completing a second taught postgraduate degree and some of that group will soon be discovering as some of the people here have done already where the continuing to a doctorate is to undergo the third degree in that phrase is positive or negative sense other types of degree have particularly familiar to the physicists and astronomers amongst you including degrees as measures of gradient another the relatives of that word gradus but it's not just the former students here who've made the grade but also all of those others parents relatives friends have contributed to this achievement you'll have dealt with the tensions of offspring unexpectedly studying at home an exercise mimicking the combined challenges of international relations and psychology and quite possibly economics too you may have been alarmed by historians tell you how similar measures against how similar measures against the plague of sixteen sixty five were to those of the initial lockdown of twenty twenty or by art historians showing a pictures of the metre long rods that london 's moment carry during that plague on one person meeting another you meant hold out your staff and keep apart the statutory to metres social distancing but to return finally to the former students commonly our graduation ceremonies end with the confirment of an honorary degree but this extraordinary ceremony all of you deserve a form of additional on read agree for making it through such challenging circumstances we have an M res a master of research they each deserve a deres doctor of resilience may your saint andrews experience stand you in good stead for your doubtless successful futures thank you please stand for the benediction gratia domini nostri yesu christi at caritas de at communicatio spiritus sancti sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism ohmen",

congratulations to all our graduates i should now like to introduce the principles medal this award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by ed and ravenscroft believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and rd makers in the world the award of the principles medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at saint andrews the awards were open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular for the academic year 2020 to 2021 the principal's medal was awarded to three outstanding students and this celebration enables us to bestow the medal in the customary way today we recognise zaynap majzoub who graduated with a master of arts with honours in arabic spanish and international relations and i am pleased to note that zaynab received a very strong first class degree zeynab applied to join the university of saint andrews through our supported pathway program which is designed to unblock potential where it had previously not been allowed to flourish senap impressed the interview panel so much that she was accepted directly into the school of international relations rather than onto the supported pathway and she was utterly triumphant in her academic endeavours from the gecko consistently ranking at the top of her class whilst doing so zenab served as an exemplary colleague to her peers including by volunteering as a mentor to incoming students on widening access programmes for over 2 years outwith the university zaynab committed substantial portions of her time to supporting people from disadvantaged backgrounds seen up work with the scottish refugee council as a children and families support worker and she spent time around her studies teaching english to refugees and asylum seekers in the UK zenab has also advocated to raise awareness of human rights crises as a humanitarian school speaker for the red cross and she supported young people as an ambassador for the prince's trust for which she was a finalist for the young ambassador of the year award in 2018 these are just a few of the organisations with which saynab has worked which range further from queen margaret university to waverley care and on subjects from decona colonising educational curricula to awareness raising about the prevalence of female genital mutilation in all of these activities they now demonstrated a deep rooted commitment to supporting others and to wielding her education for the good of the people around her and the society of which she is apart that is an exemplary way to use ones saint andrews education and i'm delighted to recognise that zaynab is pursuing further study at king kings college london where she is reading for the degree of master of science in global health zeynab in recognition of all that you achieved academically and your selfless support of others during your time as an undergraduate it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principles madam comma i call bishop wardlaw professor john hudson of the school of history vice chancellor on the guests colleagues graduates of the university it's a pleasure to be here to congratulate a group of former students this way there's a peculiar graduation it's peculiar in that you come from almost every school in the university instead of the only one or two that is customary and i'll try and mention all of you it's peculiar also in that the majority of you departed from saint andrews a year ago rather than the customary weeks ago i like both of these aspects the mixing of students of different disciplines which characterized your first years in halls 5 or even more years ago and this being your first reunion the first i hope of many and it's peculiar in that you all have been doing things other than undergraduate degrees for the last year and indeed have graduated once already gone are my chances recycling graduation address platitudes wishing you well as you enter the real world i wonder even what the correct term for you and for this ceremony is the social anthropologists amongst you will know that liminality threshold crossing is often central to rituals but in today's ritual you are all stopping stepping across the threshold from being a graduate to being a graduate let's then reflect further on the words involved classicists amongst you know that the word graduate derives from the latin grados meaning step the same word gives us the modern word grade those marks which while you were receiving them but probably no longer meant a great deal to you these grades determined the classification of your degree in such classification etymology meets mathematics and computing because modern linguists amongst you may know that the word degree likewise derives from grados as martin turned into french the deed disappeared from gradas and gave us grey or green and hence degree those of you who took english may have read charlotte bronte's villette where character hurdles up a staircase 3 degrees at a time degrees still in the mid 19th century being able to mean step and then what may reflect that degrade is exactly the same word as degree and those of you from biology chemistry earth and environmental sciences geography and sustainable development maybe in management too will know that degrade is one of those words that are shifted from being a negative to sometimes being a positive moral philosophers even ordinary language analytical philosophers might take an interest in how a preference for the non degradable might now be seen as degrading and the oddities continue some of you will be continuing in medicine and know that third degree burns are the most serious others may be at law school and know that third degree homicide is the least serious some of you now will be completing a second taught postgraduate degree and some of that group will soon be discovering as some of the people here have done already where the continuing to a doctorate is to undergo the third degree in that phrase is positive or negative sense other types of degree have particularly familiar to the physicists and astronomers amongst you including degrees as measures of gradient another the relatives of that word gradus but it's not just the former students here who've made the grade but also all of those others parents relatives friends have contributed to this achievement you'll have dealt with the tensions of offspring unexpectedly studying at home an exercise mimicking the combined challenges of international relations and psychology and quite possibly economics too you may have been alarmed by historians tell you how similar measures against how similar measures against the plague of 1665 were to those of the initial lockdown of 2020 or by art historians showing a pictures of the metre long rods that london's moment carry during that plague on one person meeting another you meant hold out your staff and keep apart the statutory to metres social distancing but to return finally to the former students commonly our graduation ceremonies end with the confirment of an honorary degree but this extraordinary ceremony all of you deserve a form of additional on read agree for making it through such challenging circumstances we have an M res a master of research they each deserve a deres dr of resilience may your saint andrews experience stand you in good stead for your doubtless successful futures thank you please stand for the benediction

Good afternoon everyone. It is my happy duty as principal and Vice Chancellor to welcome you to this summer graduation ceremony at the University of Saint Andrews. Graduation is the highlight of our academic year. At these ceremonies, students celebrate their degrees and people of distinction are honoured. We Orient our academic calendar around these occasions and they are a tradition that speaks to the heart of our institutional mission. I am delighted that all of you can join us for this. This historic graduation session marks the resumption of in person summer ceremonies after a three year. In which they were hosted online. Due to the pandemic, it is thus with a strongly renewed sense of occasion that I can welcome and address you directly, and the joy of this ceremony will be enhanced by the opportunity for our students to celebrate their successes with friends, peers, teachers. And loved ones in the usual way. This ceremony also marks our return to the younger hall, the home of our graduation ceremonies. Since it opened in 1929, the younger hall closed in July 2019 for an extensive refurbishment that has revitalised this space for the next century of its existence, whilst ensuring that the entire building is fully accessible for all its users. The buildings layout and decorations have been refreshed, but are intrinsically unchanged and the shape of the ceremonies remains the same. Our graduates will cross the younger hall stage in a style that unites them with the students who have for almost a century, crossed it before them. The broader graduation tradition which we observe today has taken place at Saint Andrews since the second decade of the 15th century, when the university was founded and some of the rituals that were established in the 1400s remain an integral part of the ceremony. These rituals honour our history and signify the assumption of each graduates place within an institution that has done as much as any other to shape our modern world. We are Scotland's first and foremost university, the third oldest in the English speaking world and one of the 25 oldest still operating. Across 609 years, students and academics have gathered here to build and disseminate knowledge, and their ambition has proved resilient to the challenges mounted against them. The religious and political regimes that have reared and crumbled the pandemics and wars that have beaten at the doors. Ours is not, however, a story of survival but of leadership. Saint Andrews's been at the vanguard of political, cultural, and intellectual developments since our inception, and our people have steered the hands of monarchs and parliaments since our earliest days. The importance of our town predates the university's foundation. Saint Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital of medieval Scotland, the 12th century cathedral, the remnants of which will look upon the graduation procession at the end of this ceremony was the largest and most revered building of its time, a centre for pilgrimage home to Scotland's senior Bishop, and consecrated upon completion in the presence of Robert the Bruce in 1318. University instruction commenced here in May 1410, when our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, invited a delegation of scholars led by Lawrence of Lindores, a philosopher of renown to the town, and university status was formalised. When Pope Benedict the 13th issued papal bulls from Peniscola in August 1413, which were met by great jubilation when carried into town the following February. The royal leaders of Scotland and later of the United Kingdom have been a guiding, enriching and at times challenging presence in our history. Saint Andrews was the spiritual home of Scotland and on occasion hosted the Scottish Court and our early leaders enjoyed close association with the Royal household. Our founder, Bishop Henry Wardlaw, served as an adviser and diplomat to King Robert the 3rd and later as tutor and Protector to his son. The future King James, the first of Scotland, who resided with him in Saint Andrews Castle for a few years before his disastrous voyage to France, which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in England for 18 years. King James Revisited St. Andrews throughout his life celebrating Christmas here in 1425 and he was so enamoured by the early university that he petitioned for its relocation to Perth. His request was dutifully and happily ignored. Our university library, the oldest continuous library in Scotland, is indebted to royal patronage. King James, the 6th of Scotland and 1st of England visited St. Andrews in 1617 and made a gift of 200 volumes to the University Library, a building in his honour. To accommodate this collection, the King James Library was completed in 1643 on South St. This was a key moment for the early library, but one suspects that King James. Was overcompensating for previous offence earlier in his reign. King James clashed repeatedly with Andrew Melville, a graduate and a distinguished and controversial theologian and religious reformer who served as Principal of Saint Mary's College from 1580 and as rector from 1590. Melville had a profound influence on the contemporary university, but was resistant to royal interference. Given the choice of putting up with an. Obstructive University administrator or removing the obstacle altogether. King James locked Melville in the Tower of London. Royal and political leaders in subsequent centuries have enjoyed more favourable relations with the university and our continuing proximity to Lockie of national and international power signifies recognition of the value that our institution has contributed to national life. Throughout its existence. We enjoy such status today in a month in which we are celebrating Her Majesty, the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. We have been honoured. By the presence of Her Majesty periodically throughout her reign, most recently at the graduation of our alumni, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a graduation ceremony very like this one in 2005. We were delighted to welcome their Royal Highnesses back to the university for a visit in May 2021 and earlier this month, we unveiled a 40th birthday portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge at the university's Wardlaw Museum. Our recently redeveloped museum, situated on the schools, which is well worth a visit. In crossing today's stage, each of our graduates follows in royal footsteps, but also in the footsteps of the academics, leaders and Changemakers who have used the knowledge they attained in this small corner of Fife to shape the world in profound ways. The journey you make from here is yours to envisage, but their example is 1, from which we can all draw inspiration. Returning now to today's ceremony and the rituals which connect us to our forebears, the first of these you have already witnessed as since our Veterans Chapel choir initiated proceedings with a rendition of the Gaudeamus and the university chaplain, the Reverend Doctor Donald McEwen delivered the opening prayer. As Vice Chancellor, I preside over these ceremonies and am invested with the authority to confer or confirm degrees, the presentation of which will immediately follow this introduction. This ceremony recognises that the class of 2021 was unable to gather in person in the usual way to celebrate their graduation and it provides us with an opportunity to redress that poor city of quintessential festivities one year later. We also recognise in the process that the Members of this graduating class were formally awarded their degrees by me through virtual conferral ceremonies in June or July 2021. And thus the graduation ritual will today be one in which degrees are confirmed rather than conferred. This graduation celebration will mirror our conventional ceremonies in every way. Although the Latin which I will use to confirm the degrees, will change very slightly so that we do not risk awarding the same degree twice. The presentation of these awards at Bachelor's Masters and doctoral level will constitute the core of this ceremony. I will call upon the Deans in turn to present candidates from their respective faculties, and I will then confirm the degree with Latin phrases, one of which, for example, translates as I confirm the degree of Master of Arts and to symbolise this I place upon you this CAP. To most though, I will simply say ET superette meaning and upon you too. The precise moment of confirmation occurs when the graduates CAP or BEREKUM touches the head of the graduate. This academic cap has been used in every ceremony since December 1696, when it was acquired from a Saint Andrews tailor and it symbolises the assumption of an equal place within our alumni community. When the Conferrals are complete, I shall then make a special presentation of the principal's Medal and award for academic and extracurricular endeavour to one of our graduates. The Principles medal for the academic year 2020 to 2021 will today be bestowed upon Zainab Majzoub, who received a joint degree from the schools of Modern Languages and International Relations. Since our theaters Chapel choir will then return to deliver a musical interlude and we are thankful both to the choir and their director, Claire Innes Hopkins for the Felicity they bring to this occasion. To close our ceremony, it is tradition to invite a member of the university to address our graduates and offer some final words of inspiration and congratulation. Today's guest speaker is Professor John Hudson from the School of History. The ceremony will then conclude with the benediction and the graduation procession. At Saint Andrews the academics and professional staff who have supported you, our graduates are immensely proud of your accomplishments, but this ritual does not mark the end of your association with Saint Andrews and you have joined a vital community of alumni who have positively shaped the world around them for 609 years. And to support one another in the present. So you are not leaving our community, but taking the next step. In your Saint Andrews experience. And it is our sincere hope that you will continue to engage as a St andrean throughout your life. Dequina's Faculty Artists arts Hilton.

I should now like to introduce the principles medal. This award was inaugurated 13 years ago with a gift from 3 anonymous donors and is supported by Ed and Ravenscroft, believed to be the oldest firm of tailors and Rd makers in the world. The award of the Principles Medal recognises students who display exceptional endeavour and achievement during their time at Saint Andrews. The awards were open to final year undergraduates and postgraduates in any discipline and the achievements celebrated are both academic and extracurricular. For the academic year 2020 to 2021, the Principal's Medal was awarded to three outstanding students, and this celebration enables us to bestow the medal in the customary way. Today, we recognise Zaynap Majzoub, who graduated with a Master of Arts with honours in Arabic, Spanish, and international relations, and I am pleased to note that Zaynab received a very strong first class degree. Zeynab applied to join the University of Saint Andrews through our supported pathway program, which is designed to unblock potential where it had previously not been allowed to flourish. Senap impressed the interview panel so much that she was accepted directly into the School of International Relations rather than onto the supported pathway, and she was utterly triumphant in her academic endeavours from the Gecko, consistently ranking at the top of her class. Whilst doing so, Zenab served as an exemplary colleague to her peers, including by volunteering as a mentor to incoming students on widening access programmes for over 2 years. Outwith the university, Zaynab committed substantial portions of her time to supporting people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Seen up work with the Scottish Refugee Council as a children and families support worker and she spent time around her studies teaching English to refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. Zenab has also advocated to raise awareness of human rights crises as a humanitarian school speaker for the Red Cross, and she supported young people as an ambassador for the Prince's Trust, for which she was a finalist for the Young Ambassador of the Year award in 2018. These are just a few of the organisations with which SAYNAB has worked, which range further from Queen Margaret University to Waverley Care and on subjects from Decona. Colonising educational curricula to awareness raising about the prevalence of female genital mutilation. In all of these activities, they now demonstrated a deep rooted commitment to supporting others and to wielding her education for the good of the people around her and the Society of which she is apart. That is an exemplary way to use ones Saint Andrews education, and I'm delighted to recognise that Zaynab is pursuing further study at King Kings College, London, where she is reading for the degree of Master of Science in Global Health. Zeynab, in recognition of all that you achieved academically and your selfless support of others during your time as an undergraduate, it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the principles, Madam. , I call Bishop Wardlaw professor John Hudson of the School of History. Vice Chancellor on the guests, colleagues, graduates of the university. It's a pleasure to be here to congratulate a group of former students. This way there's a peculiar graduation. It's peculiar in that you come from almost every school in the university instead of the only one or two that is customary, and I'll try and mention all of you. It's peculiar also in that the majority of you departed from Saint Andrews a year ago, rather than the customary weeks ago. I like both of these aspects. The mixing of students of different disciplines which characterized your first years in halls 5 or even more years ago. And this being your first reunion, the first I hope of many. And it's peculiar in that you all have been doing things other than undergraduate degrees for the last year, and indeed have graduated once already. Gone are my chances. Recycling graduation address platitudes wishing you well as you enter the real world. I wonder even what the correct term for you, and for this ceremony is the social anthropologists amongst you will know that liminality threshold crossing is often central to rituals, but in today's ritual you are all stopping stepping across the threshold from being a graduate to being a graduate. Let's then reflect further on the words involved. Classicists amongst you know that the word graduate derives from the Latin grados meaning step. The same word gives us the modern word grade. Those marks which while you were receiving them, but probably no longer meant a great deal to you. These grades determined the classification of your degree. In such classification, etymology meets mathematics and computing because modern linguists amongst you may know that the word degree likewise derives from grados. As Martin turned into French, the deed disappeared from Gradas and gave us grey or green and hence degree. Those of you who took English may have read Charlotte Bronte's. Villette, where character hurdles up a staircase 3 degrees at a time. Degrees still in the mid 19th century, being able to mean step. And then what may reflect that degrade is exactly the same word as degree. And those of you from biology, chemistry, earth, and environmental sciences, geography and sustainable development. Maybe in management too, will know that degrade is one of those words that are shifted from being a negative to sometimes being a positive. Moral philosophers, even ordinary language analytical philosophers, might take an interest in how a preference for the non degradable might now be seen as degrading. And the oddities continue. Some of you will be continuing in medicine and know that third degree burns are the most serious. Others may be at law school and know that third degree homicide is the least serious. Some of you now will be completing a second taught postgraduate degree and some of that group will soon be discovering as some of the people here have done already, where the continuing to a doctorate is to undergo the third degree in that phrase is positive or negative sense. Other types of degree have particularly familiar to the physicists and astronomers amongst you, including degrees as measures of gradient another, the relatives of that word gradus. But it's not just the former students here who've made the grade, but also all of those others parents, relatives, friends have contributed to this achievement. You'll have dealt with the tensions of offspring unexpectedly studying at home. An exercise mimicking the combined challenges of international relations and psychology. And quite possibly economics too. You may have been alarmed by historians. Tell you how similar measures against how similar measures against the plague of 1665 were to those of the initial lockdown of 2020. Or by art historians showing a pictures of the metre long rods that London's moment carry during that plague. On one person meeting another you meant hold out your staff and keep apart the statutory to metres social distancing. But to return finally to the former students. Commonly, our graduation ceremonies end with the confirment of an honorary degree, but this extraordinary ceremony all of you deserve a form of additional on read, agree for making it through such challenging circumstances. We have an M Res, a master of research. They each deserve a deres Dr of resilience. May your Saint Andrews experience stand you in good stead for your doubtless successful futures? Thank you. Please stand for the benediction. Gratia Domini Nostri Yesu Christi at Caritas de at Communicatio Spiritus Sancti Sitkum omnibus nobis in secular secularism. Ohmen"
