# St Andrews Module Database

This contains the average list of most modules at the university, averaged from up to the last 6 years, and is taken from the combination of many FOI requests.

There is a PDF version available for download, which is updated whenever required, and the Excel version [here](https://universityofstandrews907-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/dm282_st-andrews_ac_uk/EU00dxCz3EhJsQo6MnYR9XgBFjQzZt_ixZp-XPdp1TVQBw?e=wlHQ6U), which can be used for more detailed analysis and serves as the 'development' version.
