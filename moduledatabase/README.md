# St Andrews Module Database

This contains the average list of most modules at the university, averaged from up to the last 6 years, and is taken from the combination of many FOI requests.

There is a PDF version available for download, which is updated whenever required, and the Excel version, which can be used for more detailed analysis. 

|Important: Wondering why the majority of the 2018-19 (and beyond) module averages aren't available? This is because St Andrews has decided to refuse any FOI request related to module grades from June 2019 (see [this](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/average_asphmt_module_grades_201#incoming-1412618) for an example). Unfortunately, as I update my database solely from FOI requests, unless St Andrews rescinds this change, I will (mostly) not be able to make any further updates. You can still find the module averages across years with reasonable accuracy however.|
