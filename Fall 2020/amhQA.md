## When does catering start please?

It used to be 5th but it's been changed to 31st.

### Does this mean regular catering or the special catering for those of us in quarantine from the 5th?

Regular catering, quarantining student will be catered from the day they come in.

## Do our matrix cards still unlock melville and our rooms if our room has changed?

No.

## How are meals going to work at AMH next semester? Please tell me it's not going to be like when lockdown first happened!! It was terrible!!

At the moment the plan is extended meal times with all the tables separated so people can socially distance during mealtimes. Estates are still assessing capacities so theres still uncertainty on how distancing will work/ how many people are allowed in the dining hall at any one time.

## Is the TV license charged to your student account through St.A’s or paid for in person upon arrival? Who do you speak to about purchasing a TV license? 

TV licensing is a national thing and not just for St Andrews so payment for TV license is not done through the university, whether that's online or in person. If you're bringing a TV or you'll be using BBC iPlayer etc, you can buy your TV license at https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/

## Guests aren't allowed overnight at the start of the semester. When in the year will they be allowed?

We don't know that as of now. It will depend on how the year pans out but personally, I see it being unlikely during first semester. But you never know.

## During quarantine, will there be an allotted time to have daily, outdoor, individual exercise? 

Unfortunately not.

## I would like to order my bedding from Amazon so that it will be waiting for me upon arrival. If I take this route, will Melville hold my package if it arrives before I do the day I’m moving in?

Yes, you can order bedding but you should try to get it to arrive as soon before you arrive as possible, preferably on the same day.

## If we order something during quarantine will it be delivered to our room?

They’re definitely delivering food to rooms. I think they will be delivering (other items) to rooms but am not 100% sure yet. They’re still trying to work out a system. (9/8)

## Are rugs allowed in the rooms?

The rules are no soft furnishings, beyond bedding like throw pillows and blankets. So no rugs, but the rooms all have fitted carpets anyway.

## Are there irons that can be used?

Yes there's a small ironing room which contains a couple of irons and ironing boards so you don't have to bring your own. There's also a drying room, where you can leave your clothes on an airer (assuming that we can still use it due to covid)  You can't have a clothes airer up in your room though.

## Do yous know how Melvilles gonna be allocating households?

It will be based around bathrooms, they’re still sorting out how the bubbles will be arranged atm but you can kind of guess how they’ll be set out based on hoe melville is arranged. Im not sure how much melville will be affected by this, from my current understanding you can still eat etc with people not in your bubble but you will have to wear a mask and distance from them.

## if someone (e.g. partner/friend/etc.) is helping us to bring our suitcases to Melville in September, are they allowed into the hall to help us unpack/say goodbye, etc.?

Only one other person is allowed into Melville with you to help you unpack and settle in but they are not allowed to stay with you overnight. If they have to stay in St Andrews overnight, they will need to find other accommodation (hotel etc). Just another reminder that accomodation in St Andrews gets booked up very quickly so if your parents/partner etc need to book, they should do so ASAP. Only one of your parents will be allowed into the building. However, Melville has a huge outside area in front with benches where you should be able to sit and spend time with them. And the staff, wardens and committee members will do everything we can (and are allowed to) to help you move and settle in.

## Is there a community coffee pot? Or some way to make coffee in the dorms?

The communal kitchens have kettles where you can make coffee and the dining hall also has a coffee machine for at meal times.

## Are there chairs in the dorm rooms to go with the desks?

Yes there are.

## Do we know if melvil will be open over xmas break? for people who can't go home

Dra whithorn and abh will be open like it was during lockdown. However you will have to pay extra to stay over Christmas unfortunately. Its usually open over christmas you can apply in November for christmas accommodation.

## storage space in Rooms

I can't give you a specific size for the room (there's a very little amount of variation), but as well as a three quarter bed and a desk, each room has a small set of 5 shallow drawers and a wardrobe with hanging space and two deeper drawers in the bottom, as well as some coat hooks on the side. There's a metal pull out drawer underneath the bed, which takes up most of the room although there's some space for boxes around it. There's also a couple of shelves above the desk, and some around the sink.
 
## Is the WiFi good in rooms? Are there areas where it’s not great?

I found the wifi in halls to be pretty strong in the individual rooms and common areas. Any patchy moments didn't last long, and the only places it didn't reach were some of the stairwells. (Agreed, I didn't find any areas where it wasn't strong. Rarely, the WiFi is down but only for a few minutes and doesn't happen often at all)

## Will meal times look different to last year?

Normally the meal times were an hour long. We know that they will be extended and that the tables in the dining hall will probably be separated but we don't yet know how they plan on splitting the residents up to go at different times.

## Will visitors be allowed to stay with you in Melville during first semester if you live together at home? 

Usually visitors would be allowed to stay for 3 days in a row and no more than twice in a month but even that was completely stopped since March because of Covid and it will probably stay that way, at least for the first little while.

## Is it true that there's one kitchen per 100 people?

There are 3 larger kitchens (one is almost twice as large as the other 2) for everyone and smaller kitchenettes (without stoves or ovens) at the top of b and c blocks. Most people only use the kitchens for weekend dinners but even some people get takeout and most people just make microwave meals etc so it's not as bad as it sounds (you can of course use them at other times, they tend to be pretty much empty during the week)

## How many people share bathrooms?

It's 2 between 8 people, single sex. How often are they cleaned - Last year it was every weekday.
