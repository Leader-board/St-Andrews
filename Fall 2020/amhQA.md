## Does anyone know whether the households in hall will be of 8 or 16?

I think they’ll be 8 people.

## Will bedding be provided during quarantine, I haven’t ordered anything as I am still a bit unsure what room I will be quarantining in? 

Bedding will not be provided. If you don't know what room you'll be quarantining in but you know your term time room, you can still order bedding with that room number or order bedding to the building with your name, without specifying the room number.

## I’ve been trying to look for some kind of map to see where the rooms/ blocks are but can’t find anything!

![Floors 1 and 2](../../master/assets/amhQA1.jpg)

![Floors 3 and 4](../../master/assets/amhQA2.jpg)

![Floors 5, 6 and 7](../../master/assets/amhQA3.jpg)

If you take an image of the building, the blocks go left to right, with A and B to the left of the entrance and C, D and E to the right. A block is boys only and d block is girls only, all the floors are single gender. There is one large and 2 smaller common rooms in hall. Also, there's no link between the blocks on all the floors, you have to go up/down to the main concourse and travel across. Floor 3 is the main concourse, both the outdoor entrances, common rooms, dining rooms, study rooms etc all lead on from there. The common room is separated from the wings so you need to come down to 3 and go back up the stairs, same for the dining room.

**Do the blocks have separate entrances and common rooms?** The blocks each have an entrance through the main corridor, if you mean in terms of outdoor entrances no they don’t. 

**Does level 4 have an actual bar?** It gets used quite often for free bars, but we don’t have a license.

## Does anyone know if we're allowed a clothes horse/airer in our room or do we need to use the tumble dryers?

Not in your room, but there is a drying room where you can leave your stuff on a clothes airer.

## What’s the size of the pin board in the rooms?

I believe it’s something around 100x150 cm? Not 100% sure though!

## Hey, how do you know if you’re going to get a room with a small double or one of the rooms with the single bed?

I think there are only two rooms with single beds (At least C714 is).

## Do we know if there will be printers in the computer rooms?

There is a printer there, yes!

## Can we have things delivered to hall before we arrive? If not, is there somewhere we can have things delivered?

Yes, as long as it arrives as close to your arrival as possible, preferably on the same day as your arrival. Please be considerate and don't order something to arrive like a week before you do. There is also an Amazon locker next to ABH, which is the hall next to ours, which will keep your Amazon parcels for 3 days, I believe.

## Hey! If we order things online, what do we put as the address? Do we include our room number? and how does that work? Is there a mail room?

Yeah you need to include your room number when you order online. There’s a table for mail that doesn’t need signing for and if it needs signing for you can collect it from reception. And the address is

>Andrew Melville <br>
>North Haugh <br>
>St Andrews <br>
>Fife <br>
>KY16 9SU

## Hi can someone explain what the letter at the beginning of the room number means.. if it even has significance

It’s the block. There are five blocks in melville. As you walk in A and B block are to your left and C D and E block are to your right when coming through the main entrance. The first number after the letter is also your floor number. 3 is ground floor in melville. Highest level is 7. Hopefully it all becomes clear when you enter.

**Wait, are 1 and 2 in the basement then?** One and two are still above ground due to the fact the entrance steps are elevated upwards. You go downstairs but they’re still on ground level at the lowest (Melville is on a hill). The floor with all the windows is floor 3, which you go up stairs to enter. Below that are floors 1 and 2.

## Are small portable/handheld fans that can be placed on desks allowed? (the charging cable has a USB port)

Yes, as long as it passes the pat test at the start of the semester.

## This may be a dumb question but what’s the pat test?

It's just a test they do on all your personal electrical items (phone chargers, laptop chargers, hairdryers etc) to make sure they're safe for use in halls. 

**Do you guys know if we’re allowed adapters bought in the UK?** Yes, the main criterion is the 3-pin adaptor (+ it should be earthed). If your laptop is from the US (like mine) or one that does not use a 3-pin adaptor, you should try to get one that's three pin. It's fine to change the heads with a different one, however, you cannot circumvent by using a extension cord/travel adaptor - they'll take the entire charger away.

## When are we supposed to get our room number?

A lot of people who have received their accomodation offer has received their room numbers. You can check on my Saint > details and development > Student Finance > bank letter.

## Will we know our roommate before we arrive?

If both of you choose to update your room number on here, you will automatically find or you can ask "is anyone in room X" on here too.

## Will RBS be providing kettles in rooms during quarantine like ABH did?

Unfortunately not.

## See to park my car in the big car park at the bottom of Andrew Melville do i need a parking permit/to pay/ free of charge?

You can apply for free student permits after matriculation (https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/environment/sustainabletravel/travellingbycar/studentcars).

## Will people who live in 2 different households in Melville allowed to be in each others room? Eg if my friend lives in a different block and household, will they be able to hang out in my room with me or only members of the same household?

No, to hang out with people from a different household, you have to be socially distant which is not possible in the bedrooms.

## Will friends that don't live in Melville be allowed to come into the building during the semester if they're wearing a mask, etc. or will this not be allowed?

We're not 100% sure but they probably won't be allowed into the building. You can still meet outside though, so that's probably best

## What happens if you get locked out during quarantine?

Please please try not to get locked out in those 2 weeks, put a big sign up on your door reminding you to remember your matric card etc or double tap your door during the day (if you're comfortable with that) so that it doesn't automatically lock itself. Just be really careful to not lock yourself out. If you do lock yourself out, if it's during the day, message here and someone will send the porter/maintenance staff up and if it's in the evening, save the warden's number on your phone and call them or if you don't have their number, message here and someone will send it in.

## How do I change my arrival slot?? Do I email or is there an online portal

> If you have already completed your e-induction you can now go back in and select a date and time slot. If you select an arrival slot between 31st August to 5th September there is no additional charge. We strongly advise against making any firm travel arrangements before booking your arrival date and time. 

That's what it said in an email about selecting a slot on the accomodation portal but if that's only for selecting and you are unable to change your slot then email studacc@. (I chose a slot but then I chose a different time for the free pickup from the station (because I couldn’t do the first slot) and they said this changed the slot automatically.) Yeah, if you've book the free uni transport, they will change a slot for you themselves depending on what they've arranged

**I booked a slot because I thought I had to and now need to change it** If you are unable to do so in the prearrival section of the accommodation portal then email studacc@.

## Hey! My flight is very late in the evening and I think I'll be in Melville past midnight. What should I do to be able to get in?

Message here and if someone is in melville and they're up, they'll let you in. If not, call the wardens on 01334467077. If you've booked the free airport transport the uni is offering, they might put something in place for you though (they should let the residence staff or the wardens know. If you already have your matric card, that should let you in too).

## When does catering start please?

It used to be 5th but it's been changed to 31st.

### Does this mean regular catering or the special catering for those of us in quarantine from the 5th?

Regular catering, quarantining student will be catered from the day they come in.

## Do our matrix cards still unlock melville and our rooms if our room has changed?

No.

## How are meals going to work at AMH next semester? Please tell me it's not going to be like when lockdown first happened!! It was terrible!!

At the moment the plan is extended meal times with all the tables separated so people can socially distance during mealtimes. Estates are still assessing capacities so theres still uncertainty on how distancing will work/ how many people are allowed in the dining hall at any one time.

## Is the TV license charged to your student account through St.A’s or paid for in person upon arrival? Who do you speak to about purchasing a TV license? 

TV licensing is a national thing and not just for St Andrews so payment for TV license is not done through the university, whether that's online or in person. If you're bringing a TV or you'll be using BBC iPlayer etc, you can buy your TV license at https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/

## Guests aren't allowed overnight at the start of the semester. When in the year will they be allowed?

We don't know that as of now. It will depend on how the year pans out but personally, I see it being unlikely during first semester. But you never know.

## During quarantine, will there be an allotted time to have daily, outdoor, individual exercise? 

Unfortunately not.

## I would like to order my bedding from Amazon so that it will be waiting for me upon arrival. If I take this route, will Melville hold my package if it arrives before I do the day I’m moving in?

Yes, you can order bedding but you should try to get it to arrive as soon before you arrive as possible, preferably on the same day.

## If we order something during quarantine will it be delivered to our room?

They’re definitely delivering food to rooms. I think they will be delivering (other items) to rooms but am not 100% sure yet. They’re still trying to work out a system. (9/8)

## Are rugs allowed in the rooms?

The rules are no soft furnishings, beyond bedding like throw pillows and blankets. So no rugs, but the rooms all have fitted carpets anyway.

## Are there irons that can be used?

Yes there's a small ironing room which contains a couple of irons and ironing boards so you don't have to bring your own. There's also a drying room, where you can leave your clothes on an airer (assuming that we can still use it due to covid)  You can't have a clothes airer up in your room though.

## Do yous know how Melvilles gonna be allocating households?

It will be based around bathrooms, they’re still sorting out how the bubbles will be arranged atm but you can kind of guess how they’ll be set out based on hoe melville is arranged. Im not sure how much melville will be affected by this, from my current understanding you can still eat etc with people not in your bubble but you will have to wear a mask and distance from them.

## if someone (e.g. partner/friend/etc.) is helping us to bring our suitcases to Melville in September, are they allowed into the hall to help us unpack/say goodbye, etc.?

Only one other person is allowed into Melville with you to help you unpack and settle in but they are not allowed to stay with you overnight. If they have to stay in St Andrews overnight, they will need to find other accommodation (hotel etc). Just another reminder that accomodation in St Andrews gets booked up very quickly so if your parents/partner etc need to book, they should do so ASAP. Only one of your parents will be allowed into the building. However, Melville has a huge outside area in front with benches where you should be able to sit and spend time with them. And the staff, wardens and committee members will do everything we can (and are allowed to) to help you move and settle in.

## Is there a community coffee pot? Or some way to make coffee in the dorms?

The communal kitchens have kettles where you can make coffee and the dining hall also has a coffee machine for at meal times.

## Are there chairs in the dorm rooms to go with the desks?

Yes there are.

## Will Melville be open over Christmas break for people who can't get home?

You can apply in November for Christmas accomodation but you have to pay extra to stay in Melville over Christmas.

## storage space in Rooms

I can't give you a specific size for the room (there's a very little amount of variation), but as well as a three quarter bed and a desk, each room has a small set of 5 shallow drawers and a wardrobe with hanging space and two deeper drawers in the bottom, as well as some coat hooks on the side. There's a metal pull out drawer underneath the bed, which takes up most of the room although there's some space for boxes around it. There's also a couple of shelves above the desk, and some around the sink.
 
## Is the WiFi good in rooms? Are there areas where it’s not great?

I found the wifi in halls to be pretty strong in the individual rooms and common areas. Any patchy moments didn't last long, and the only places it didn't reach were some of the stairwells. (Agreed, I didn't find any areas where it wasn't strong. Rarely, the WiFi is down but only for a few minutes and doesn't happen often at all)

## Will meal times look different to last year?

Normally the meal times were an hour long. We know that they will be extended and that the tables in the dining hall will probably be separated but we don't yet know how they plan on splitting the residents up to go at different times.

## Will visitors be allowed to stay with you in Melville during first semester if you live together at home? 

Usually visitors would be allowed to stay for 3 days in a row and no more than twice in a month but even that was completely stopped since March because of Covid and it will probably stay that way, at least for the first little while.

## Is it true that there's one kitchen per 100 people?

There are 3 larger kitchens (one is almost twice as large as the other 2) for everyone and smaller kitchenettes (without stoves or ovens) at the top of b and c blocks. Most people only use the kitchens for weekend dinners but even some people get takeout and most people just make microwave meals etc so it's not as bad as it sounds (you can of course use them at other times, they tend to be pretty much empty during the week)

## How many people share bathrooms?

It's 2 between 8 people, single sex. How often are they cleaned - Last year it was every weekday.
