## Studres PDF Compiler

This is an automated script that collates the PDF of every lecture from the Student Resources Server (https://studres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) and uploads it to a designated directory on OneDrive. This should be helpful for revision. All modules except CS1002 and CS2003 have full bookmark support enabled so you can jump from/to any lecture.

Currently the collation is available at https://tinyurl.com/y2cd8dm2. St Andrews login is required.

Please let me know if there are bugs - using GitHub or Discord or email. 

This is a beta: V1.0 Beta 2. Some lecture collations can be weird or have incorrect ordering - let me know in that case.
