# Studres PDF Compiler

This is an automated script that collates the PDF of every lecture from the Student Resources Server (https://studres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) and uploads it to a designated directory on OneDrive. This should be helpful for revision. Most modules have full bookmark support enabled so you can jump from/to any lecture (the rest have rotation issues).

Currently the collation is available at https://tinyurl.com/y2cd8dm2. St Andrews login is required.

Please let me know if there are bugs - using GitHub or Discord or email.

This is a beta: V1.0 Beta 4. Some lecture collations can be weird or have incorrect ordering - let me know in that case.
