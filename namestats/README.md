# Names database
This is latest as of September 2021.

Note that students who are in a Leave of Absence should usually be included in the list, but not former staff, alumni or terminated students. Also note that the names in the list are usually the official name and not the preferred name (where they exist).

## Publicly available

Every first and last name with at least 30 occurrences.

The full dataset is no longer available because of privacy concerns, and because I am no longer at St Andrews.
